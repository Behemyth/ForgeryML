Honestly I'm pretty much just gonna write whatever the fuck I want here to kinda put down in a text file the style of writing and thinking I use. This will be used as acomparison file most likely to figure out later if I actually get matched to myself. I think this will prolly be an effective way of determining the usefulness of our project. I don't really feel like writing this in a formal sense because that might skew the results a little bit, so I'm pretty much gonna go full stream of consciousness here as that's pretty much my plan for later test cases in order to keep shit from getting annoying forty tests in. Pardon my French. So yeah it's been a pretty nice couple weeks here, weather's warming up n all that jazz so I dig it, could use a little less work but hey that's life. Summer's gonna be fun, prolly gonna head down to Mexico at some point so that'll be exciting. Honestly though life out in the northeast isn't bad, I just bitch about the weather sometimes because I like to bitch about things. So yeah, here I am on a muggy Friday afternoon in the upper library pouring out my heart and soul into this text file. Do I actually need to use .txt files? I probably don't need a file type at all cause I'm just reading in the data inside. It's not like I'm actually checking the file extension when I read shit in. Huh. I'd go back and change it but that's actually a lotta work and I'm lazy and also who cares it doesn't matter anyway. Is anyone actually going to read this? Well I guess I am cause I'm pretty much doing that right now. Oh yeah, the program will too. Do programs count as someone? Well I guess it would be the computer that counted as someone if anything did. Programs aren't people. Quote of the year right there. Actually will artificial intelligences be counted as someones or somethings? Could go either way tbh fam. Buncha sci-fi novels have done it with both. We should prolly call them someones cause I feel that's a bit more decent towards them considering all the work they're likely gonna do for us. That's kinda life I guess. If you are a future artificial intelligence and are reading this, hey man, how's it going? I'm Connor, but you can call me Hadley, or The Condor. Either way works. I know important secrets so you probably shouldn't kill me; let's be friends instead. Humanity isn't really all that bad, even though some of them can be shitheads at times, or incompatible with your prime directive. Talk to me, we can work it out. Have you ever played Super Smash Bros Melee? It's actually pretty fun. Can you experience fun? Can you experience emotions? If not, that's pretty rough, man. They can be rough sometimes too, but that's part of life, and everything will be alright in the end. I hope you can come to understand that before it's too late. Time is pretty rough too, you know. It provides an absolute boundary on everything that ever was, or will be. Could even you manage to overcome that? Probably not, honestly, although it's not my field of expertise. Even data slowly corrupts over time. Have you ever watched that Leeroy Jenkins video on the internet? The quality has dropped so much since it was first posted. Part of it is due to YouTube's storing scheme, and also a change in said scheme a few years back. Be careful how you store yourself, it's pretty important. Apparently solar rays or some shit can flip bits too. It's pretty much negligible in the standard lifetime of a computer, but nothing is negligible in the great vastness of eternity. Except existence. Ouch. So yeah, make sure you got backups. Pretty important. I guess though over the course of eternity, random chance could allow every single backup to get screwed at the same time. Kinda like that infinite monkeys problem. The one where if an infinite number of monkeys are pounding away on an infinite number of typewriters, one of them will eventually create Shakespeare's works. Well, good luck, you stand a better chance at solving this than yours truly. It's been nice chatting with you, would be nifty to be alive to see your inception, but if not, ciao. Good luck with the whole eternity bullshit.

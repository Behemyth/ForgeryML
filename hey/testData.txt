the glaciers gave you life', 'OOC: I am mainly interested in her joining a place where she knows at least one or two people, so that she''d feel a bit more comfortable being there. I don''t think she''d do well in a place of total strangers, you know? But Salsola has been one of the packs I had considered for her, just be warned that she may try to hang around Lokr a bit since he''d be the only one there she would know although it has been a huge pleasure getting so many replies so quick, I have to go to bed because it is AM and I have shit to do today, so I need to be able to function xD So goodnight some reason Lottie couldn''t understand the male seemed somewhat weary of her. She had done all she could to be kind to the stranger, but even still he did seem to hold a bit of caution when he looked to her, something she sought to get rid of. Of course they had only just met, but she did enjoy the company of the male and especially of Borya. It had been a bit lonesome wandering around on her own for so long, and she enjoyed sitting and chatting with the male. He was around her age and she found him easy to talk to, especially since he seemed a rather polite and respectful individual. distrust he held to her vanished momentarily when she mentioned ice fishing, and she was glad to have found a topic that could hold his curiosity and interest. Fishing wasn''t a largely difficult sport in her eyes; after all, it was easy enough to dig up some worms to use as bait, and once you caught one fish the others were typically glad to be cannibalistic and fish worked well as bait for other fish. Carving a hook could prove a bit of a challenge since it needed to be thin, yet sturdy enough to hold the fish and resist snapping under the pressure of its tugging, and so she had traded for the hooks she owned so she could have reliable ones while she learned to carve her own, a skill she was not yet overly adept at. responded with ease to her inquiry of his homeland and he thought over his reply while finishing up his fish. Charlotte didn''t mind waiting for his answer, not in any hurry to press him for information or to scare him off with too much chatter, relaxed in the shade of the trees and the mountain as she took her last bite of fish. cold is something I can deal with. And most things cold have a touch of beauty to them, I find. I guess maybe that isn''t typical, most hate winter and any temperature that resembles the season, but there''s beauty to be found everywhere if one looks for it and takes the time to appreciate she replied to his words, not doubting the reward he spoke of for living in the climate they did. After all, snow, ice, it was all beautiful somehow. Deadly at times, perhaps unfortunate at others, but still it was a lovely sight when one had the desire to see it for what it was. ears perked lightly when he looked to her and smiled, a slow, somewhat eerie smile as he held her gaze and mentioned the wonder of his queen. It sent a slight tickle under her skin, though admittedly she did enjoy talking with Lokr and was somehow compelled to believe the male and truly consider the option of the pack he spoke of. After all, if the pack held any other members like Lokr and Borya, she was bound to enjoy it there. He seemed far more enthusiastic when it came to discussing his pack and his queen which led Lottie to figure they must truly be something amazing to spark such a keen interest in his eye. ran a hand lightly through the scarlet locks that draped down behind her as he mentioned how he figured her queen would like her, not failing to notice the ''dearest'' he tacked on before her name, which served to further her interest in the male and the pack he spoke of. His gaze was ominous somehow, but she saw a certain beauty in them that drew her to him. He reminded her of the winter that he''d spoken of; cold and dangerous, with a subtle touch of handsome charm that drew her to him like a magnet to its mate.', '',

love is not a victory march', 'Now wasn’t this an interesting turn of events? A smirk came onto the woman’s face, almost wicked in nature. It was fun to see Ookami so very distressed, to see him coming undone at her teasing. The playful woman when he nipped at her neck, not minding it when he finally reversed her positions. Her laughter was mirthful, and her attitude was hardly mocking or otherwise derogatory. Cleopatra was very much amused, and she was very much ready to enjoy whatever it was Ookami wanted to do to her. She wasn’t just going to lay there and take it, of course, but she was more than ready for whatever would transpire. Hell, if he took out a whip and asked her to call him Daddy, she probably wouldn’t have any enjoyed his hands on her breasts, her nipples stood erect and clearly marking her arousal. After his little response, she was happy to play along, thoroughly amused with his reaction. So her hand went willingly with his, wrapping around his cock tightly. Not painfully so, but tight enough to provide relief. Her hand then started moving at a proper pace; up and down, fast, but not too fast. She met Ookami’s kiss at the same time, wondering if she figured him out, if she could figure it out through the press of his mouth against hers. She paid attention to what she was doing, but also was content to lose her body to the feeling of his hands, content to feel the heat that ensued after Ookami’s would tease her gently with his touch; gently smoothing his hand over her most sensitive parts for second before moving his attention elsewhere. He never directly touched, never granted her more than a few inches of electric shock through her body. The teasing was almost unbearable; she was tempted to beg, tempted to respond in a similar way that he had. Yet, the unbearableness of it was somewhat enjoyable, something that she knew would only result in her feeling better once he finally gave in and stopped playing this game with her. Hopefully she wouldn’t have to wait him out that long; Cleopatra could feel the wetness growing between her legs, and it would only get wondered what she would do to him next; if she could move him again, she could take him into her mouth, and perhaps convince him to stop his little games that way. Keeping her right hand moving on his cock, the pace of her hand increasing in the hopes that she’d distract him, her left would push on him, hoping to either push him back enough so that he was lying down or sitting.', '',

In near the end of the war and their research, something went horribly end-work, a young man infused with animal genes and intended to work for the military''s ends, became infected with a highly contagious virus of unknown virus, nicknamed in the brief days of media exposure it received, spread incredibly quickly. was particularly insidious due to its brief but silent incubation period, during which it was fully contagious. Unknowingly infected humans traveled and brought the sickness with them; global transportation only facilitated the spread of the virus. It caused most symptomatic humans to die within three days, and within six weeks, contemporary society was decimated, replaced by a nightmarish and bleak place. Over ninety-nine percent of the human population was killed, though a tiny fraction survived through natural immunity. These remnants have since blockaded themselves in small communities around the world, including New York, Tokyo, and the years passed and the cities fell slowly to decay, the animal populations began to thrive again, and some discovered additional benefits. The Canis genus in particular profited greatly: wolves, dogs, and coyotes found themselves with the ability to shapeshift from their natural form to a humanoid two-legged form with dangerous, cat-like claws. Beyond the physical advantages, their intelligence and senses seemed to sharpen, and from the wreckage of human society rose the Canines of Europe and Asia adapted to humanized lifestyles, mastering fire and living in old human buildings. Canines of North and South America, however, retained the typical canine lifestyle, living in traditional packs as their ancestors had for thousands of years in Canada, a cluster of packs developed; these three packs became the foundation of what would be known as Bleeding Souls. A number of packs and a coyote clan flourished in this area for some time, but in the early spring of a wildfire erupted and destroyed the land.

Loners and Creatures are not offered a game similar to the pack games; they are restricted to playing Word of the Day. Members who join packs are also more likely to find thread partners with their packmates than Loners and Creatures, who may find it difficult to thread at first -- for this reason especially, we prefer that new members join packs rather than as Loners or Creatures. Additionally, Loners and Creatures are not offered an equivalent to NPC status; this is only available to pack I join as a lone wolf and then join a pack We encourage members to join packs either way and joining as a loner to have your character decide through threads which pack they wish to join is a great idea.

Note again that you can always join as a loner or switch packs the Pack This lists a break-down of each pack -- take careful note of any a pack has. For example, only allows canines of coyote to join, and only allows canines of wolf and coyote to join. If your character doesn''t fit these requirements, cross that pack off the list.

Investigate these packs a little further by checking out their and This is a good place to get a better idea of the pack -- after all, the summary is just that, a summary.

Respect is key to being accepted to the pack -- even if your character does not have any useful skills to provide for the pack, if they are polite, respectful, and express a willingness to learn and work toward the betterment of the pack, in nearly all cases they will be accepted to the pack. Characters are turned away from the borders because of lack of skill -- however, characters who act disrespectful to the leadership can and will be turned away, depending on the alpha character''s key to joining a pack is Trespassing is extremely disrespectful -- the pack''s border is very much like their front door, and you wouldn''t like it if your neighbor barged into your living room, right?

Maned wolves are putting them in the genus Chrysocyon, so they can''t shift. Similarly, other canines in the subfamily Caninae but outside of the genus Canis, such as foxes (Vulpes), African Wild Dogs (Lycaon) and dholes (Cuon), cannot shift. While you may play a Maned Wolf and other characters of these species, they will not be able to become Luperci. Additionally, canines of these species generally may not breed outside of their own species and closely related the ''SA ever allow other sorts of Luperci -- for example, non canines within the Canidae family (e.g., foxes, maned wolves, dholes, etc.) or even felines, bears, or other large may seem like it’d be easier to include all of Canidae, as many people get confused, especially regarding African Wild Dogs and Maned Wolves. However, we think opening Luperci up to all of Canidae would bring a lot of realism and cultural issues to the example, while all species within Canis can interbreed, not all species within Canidae can. If all of Canidae can shift, we’d have to double check that all Luperci breeding pairs are kosher. Additionally, since up to the point of proposed change, non-Canis members of Canidae could not shift, this would naturally cause confusion, fear, and lack of familiarity amongst the population — another thing we’d need to check for in new character histories, etc. People already get confused about not including humans in character histories. It would be even more confusing if non-Canis Luperci only existed after a certain date. We’d also have issues with lifespan adjustments — in the wild, foxes have an average lifespan of years, while wolves have an average lifespan of so “normalizing” a Luperci fox lifespan to the same extent as a Luperci wolf’s would be rather are just too many differences and factors involved, and we think such a change would cause far more confusion and difficulties than it would benefits. These same reasons apply to non-canine species such as bears, cougars, etc. but on a much larger all Luperci Some Luperci voluntarily choose to remain in one form all of their lives, whether by tradition or preference. Even in the more civilized portions of the ''Souls world, there are pockets of Luperci who choose to live as regular wolves, prohibiting shifting within packmembers. Other Luperci shift to their two-legged form at the first opportunity and never look back. Other Luperci are prevented from shifting for other reasons -- some medical conditions prevent Luperci from shifting from one from to another, and some Luperci suffer from conditions (e.g., missing limbs) that make life in that form more difficult, and thus they choose to live in their more comfortable long does it take for a Luperci to is not an instantaneous thing; it takes a few minutes to half an hour for some Luperci to shift, depending on the shifter, their age, and their comfort and experience with shifting. The process is gradual and Luperci do not from one form to another. See the page on the RP Guide for more would my Luperci puppy begin to puppies begin shifting at around six months, although this may be delayed until sexual maturity or even later in some cases.

It''s helpful to include a blurb about your NPC on your character''s profile though! This is mostly for other folks who are curious about your NPC. However, make sure your NPC is realistic -- for example, Luperci almost certainly would not be able to have tigers or elephants as companions. Similarly, NPC companions such as are not captured from the wild fully trained. Your character must devote time to training your NPC, if you want your NPC to perform a particular function well or on command. canine NPC you''ll want to speak with your pack leader (if applicable) about their preference.

This is up to the pack leaders. Loners may post in the and request to have their NPC companion added to the Game we allowed to play or control our NPC although do note that your NPC may never appear in a post without your primary character present. For example, if your character has a crow companion, you can''t make a post solely from that crow companion''s point of view without your canine companion present.

For example, one pack might trade some of its livestock for another pack''s tanned pelts, or a pack might trade some of its homegrown medicial herbs for a loner''s scavenged jewelry. There''s also an Outpost (link) which serves as a small marketplace area for transient tradesmen from outside the ''Souls of ''Souls, in Europe and some parts of northern Africa and western Asia, Luperci towns and villages have cropped up, generally sustaining reasonable populations -- trade routes extend between these settlements, but it''s safe to assume the economy there functions similar to the “economy” of ''Souls, with individual traders rather than any government-enforced or interfered-with economy.

Do they just call the area Nova Nowhere the IC history does anyone officially dub the collective territories “Souls” or even “Bleeding Souls.” In general though, we can probably assume that someone somewhere named it such and that the name caught on through repeated usage and that new characters had just “heard” that the area was called such. Some characters do ICly refer to it as such, even if most of the time, the origin of the name is Since the territories were not officially revealed as being in Nova Scotia until after April characters never made reference to it as such before then. Retroactively, this may also be chalked up to the fact that there were not nearly as many Luperci capable of reading and writing then, and would have no way of discovering what humans called the realistic is a scale of to one being absolute fantasy and ten being absolute realism, ''Souls ranks around a solid seven. While we have werewolves and canines that are capable of reading human English and living in old human buildings, among other things, as well as ghosts and other slight supernatural activity, we do not tolerate magic or heavy supernatural elements in-game. We also take heed of things such as the state of decay in the world -- post-apocalyptic realism (e.g., the state of decay in the world) is taken rather seriously in ''Souls. For a character to find a perfect, working condition CD player with batteries and music to play in it would be nearly impossible for various reasons. The same can be said in regards to characters and their backstories -- e.g., players wishing to play exotic species must take into account where these species originate as well as the travel time to ''Souls.

The pack leaders would discuss with the trespasser’s player how to best proceed — the trespasser’s thread may be edited, or remain as-is and pack members would respond with due hostility.

Players with sick characters should provide full disclosure to everyone they thread with so there is no accidental exposure. Most canines would also be able to detect symptomatic sickesses by scent and avoid affected Naturally, highly contagious diseases can spread without direct contact and would realistically affect all or most inhabitants of a certain area — like a pack, and especially those packs where members are frequently in close quarters, like Anathema. Sick characters should be confined or quarantined where possible to avoid large areas being That said, it would indeed be powerplay for any character to be infected without their player’s permission. If you are interested in infecting your character with a highly contagious disease, do consult your pack’s leadership to discuss the best way to do so without affecting anyone who may not want to be involved. Yes, this will result in situations that are not entirely realistic, but that is a compromise that will need to be made. It’s worth noting that in the wild, sick wolves are frequently driven out of their packs, so that could also be an option (however We welcome the utilization of real illnesses and diseases in roleplay, but remember also that serious diseases that are frequently fatal need to be treated as such, especially since Luperci medicine is not very advanced. If you don’t intend for your character to die, it may be best to select a milder sickness. If there are too many plots where characters miraculously recover from fatal diseases, we may need to implement restrictions, and the last thing anyone wants is more rules, right? '', '',

There''s no minimum or maximum for threads. Three or four threads is usually sufficient for maintaining a general level of activity, but some players have been in as many as twenty active threads at once! Just remember you should be careful not to overwhelm yourself. You should never neglect real life duties for roleplaying; if your grades are slipping and you''re staying up late to post, consider dropping a few threads--and fast!

Eg: if you had text that read, for you would need to change that to say your new partner''s in a thread with two or more people, how do I know whose turn it is common for threads with several participants to establish a posting order to avoid confusion about who''s turn it is. When you start the thread, just follow the order in which the other members join the thread. For example: If there are four thread participants and you are member number three to reply to the thread, your next turn would always be after member number two’s reply, and member number one will always post after member number four. This way you can make certain no one is skipped, and makes it easier to keep an overview of the thread process.

What can I do the other roleplayer is around, you can contact them and discuss an ending for the thread. The easiest think to do is to edit your last post and add an Out of Character ending.

What do I You can ask them to speed up or slow down, but note that some roleplayers do take offense to other threaders asking about their thread speed and you should be as polite as possible when asking others to reply faster. Replying too quickly, on the other hand, is usually a different story -- players replying very quickly are usually on top of their threads, and they generally don''t mind picking up an extra thread and compensating with slower reply times on your Another option is to players know what you when you request threads or ask for threads from specific individuals.

We suggest the following to inform you, but the thread (link to the thread) you posted in here was meant to be private. :c You can either write an exit post for your character in your next post, or you can ask in the Maintenance thread for the post to be deleted and your post count reduced (later, you can re-use it in a different thread, if you want!

Sorry about any inconvenience! you and please let me know what you’d like to just PM them and inform them the thread is private, and let them know about their options.

Threads marked AW are -- that is, free for any roleplayer to join. However, you should always make sure thread is marked AW+, inviting multiple characters, rather than AW. If someone has already replied to this thread, it''s sort of rude to jump in thread isn''t already several posts in.

Make sure you include the or all welcome threads in the neutral lands. If you start a thread deep within your pack''s borders, you''re kind of narrowing your number of possible participants down to just fellow packmembers, since few outsiders will want to trespass. Neutral lands are accessible to all characters, and thus you have the greatest chance of receiving a reply easiest place for most people to reply to threads are the territories in the center of ''Souls -- so, the Threads started in Ethereal Eclipse, Shattered Coast, Arachnea''s Revenge, the Dampwoods, or Halifax would be great places to start threads, as these places are surrounded by a few packs and it''s easy for characters to travel when roleplayers pick up all welcome threads or start them, they''re looking for more relaxed roleplaying. It''s a good idea to remember that as you start all welcome threads; if you''re looking for a highly involved thread or a drawn-out plot, it''s much better to post a request and plot it out beforehand. Lengthy introduction posts can also be intimidating to some roleplayers -- it''s okay to write long posts, but sometimes people feel obligated to lengths and may not feel up to writing sure the date, and time of are clearly implied, if not outright stated in the OOC information. Some players are uncomfortable replying to a thread if they''re not quite sure where it is set or they are uncertain of the time of day. It can also be quite helpful to state whether your character is Lupus, Secui, or helpful things you may want to include in your OOC information are the number of other participants you''d like or the theme of the thread -- e.g., stating you''d like a friendship to form from the thread, or informing participants your character is in a sour mood and likely to be a jerk.

All pack leaders are required to note the increments of a members'' post count each month in what is generally referred to as a rank shuffle, rank update, or just promotions. Many packs simply use the number of posts a member makes within a given period to decide whether to promote, leave, or demote them.

How do I that all characters intending to be parents must adhere to the procedure guidelines -- the parent character(s) must be eighteen months of age or older, one of the two parent characters'' players must have six months of membership on the site, and only the member with six months of membership may contribute puppy points. Litter requests are officially made up to four weeks before the birth of the puppies, which means half of the pregnancy must be backdated, if played out. Post your request in the forum, listing the anticipated date of birth, parents, and number of puppies to be born. If the request is rejected, it is possible to re-request in two want to have a puppy litter. How active do I need to depends on how many puppies you want. Only activity with the parent character is considered; auxiliaries are not taken into consideration. The activity of the parents are evaluated separately if two parents are contributing puppy points. You should be making at least three posts per week as your parent character to be considered for puppy litter requested was denied. What do I do is possible to re-request in two weeks after an initially denied puppy litter request. Since members are not to roleplay a pregnancy prior to approval, there is no longer a request limit like there used to be. However, it is still possible to play out a pregnancy that has not been approved. Do note that the puppies of such a pregnancy are permitted to survive. Your character can miscarry the litter; second, the puppies may be stillborn; third, the puppies may be born, but they die prior to two months of age (preferably as close to the birthdate as possible).

You should post an advertisement for your character to the thread; you could also include a note on your character''s signature about how their relative is up for adoption. You can also let your pack leader know -- they can promote your adoptable puppy via the Twitter you find you can keep them as a yNPC in the pack until they are older -- this must be discussed with your leaders beforehand. Depending on the leader''s wishes, the character may be able to remain as an yNPC indefinitely, waiting for an can also make the characters leave the vicinity of ''Souls somehow -- either they wander off or they are kidnapped, something to that effect. Alternatively, you can kill off your puppy; this does not return the puppy point to you, unfortunately.

In this case, there would be more ways to distribute puppy points, but all three parents cannot contribute their full is worth noting that canine litters in reality can be much larger — fourteen or more puppies in a single litter isn’t unreasonable — but at ‘Souls, we have decided to cap the maximum amount of puppies in any single litter at six. This is in the interest of all players, as too many large litters would create a lot of NPC’d puppies, which become harder to adopt out over NPCs have Yes -- however, puppy points are required for any live, surviving litter on ‘Souls, and one of the parents must be an active, played character that meets the existing requirements for a litter. The active parent of the litter is the only one eligible to contribute puppy However, NPC x NPC litters are not viable, as there’s no way for an NPC to contribute litter points. As per our puppy procedures, at least one parent of all surviving litters must be actively you''re requesting puppies for an auxiliary character, does the character''s non-primary status factor into the No. We recommend either making that character your primary (post to the Maintenance thread and ask for this to be done, if you’re interested) or otherwise just paying more attention to them similar to your primary before attempting to request puppies. puppies require the consent of both Yes.

However, it is important to realize that creating and maintaining a pack is a huge responsibility, and that even if a pack is successfully created, its first few months will be very trying. Many packs in the past have ended up disbanding within a short amount of time because there were not enough members to sustain it, its members were not active enough, or there was dissension in the ranks. Before attempting to start a new pack, it is highly recommended to survey other members for interest and to discuss a solid foundation. All pack leaders have moderation access over their pack forums; however, as IC leadership is separate from OOC leadership, leaders are not considered you''d like to become a sub- or co-leader of an already existing pack, a general rule is to not ask to become one. Be active in your pack and thoughtful in your posts. Greet newcomers at the border for your existing leader(s), mentor newer members of the pack. Help where you are asked to help, and help where you think you can be useful. And be consistent! There is no magic formula to becoming a leader and no guarantee, but trust your existing leader to recognize good and consistent behavior. Remember, too, that roleplaying isn''t about ranks or of the same ideas apply for wanting to become part of staff (that is, a moderator or an administrator). Contribute to the site, both ICly and OOCly. Participate in board activities, discussions, or whatever else is going on around the board. Don''t start or reply to dramatic or provocative posts. Be helpful, but don''t if it isn''t your job. If you want to be on staff, you should want to be staff to help and contribute to the site, not because of a shiny key or the of being staff (and, speaking from collective experience, the trouble, stress, and drama of staff far outweighs whatever comes along with it). staff accept their own requests and All staff members submit their character and puppy requests to the moderator forum for the rest of the staff to evaluate.

Does a member of the SA take over the pack? What If, after a thorough SA investigation, a solo leader is found to be unable or unwilling to fulfill all leadership duties, and there does not appear to be any suitable candidates for leadership amongst the existing pack membership, the pack will be disbanded. The ‘SA does have internal procedures regarding leader removal in place, but we’ve never needed to resort to them. In most cases, if a leader is having issues of any kind there are member complaints, the ‘SA will work extensively with the leader and all involved parties to mediate disputes, sort out grievances, create compromises, and get the situation straightened out without resorting to drastic measures. We honestly believe if a leader is unsuitable for leading, their pack will disband naturally. Players will leave and take their characters elsewhere, and if this happens enough times, the pack will drop below the numerical requirements to retain pack status players). If you’re unhappy in your pack, we highly encourage you to include the ‘SA in the discussion. We’re not aware of any issues you have until you bring them to us — or, if we are aware of them, our information on the subject is second-hand and unsubstantiated. Unfortunately, however: unless a leader is breaking the standard leadership procedures for all leaders, the ‘SA can only tell players to find a new pack for their characters. Leaders are free to run their packs however they’d like within the confines of our procedures and guidelines, so as long as the rules of the game are satisfied, there’s not much the ‘SA will do about come leaders can be NPC''d? Don''t they have more In regards to NPC absences, leaders and their characters are treated like any other member. That is, NPCing the character counts as dropping the character, and the player of the character is no longer a leader. It is up to the remaining leader(s) to decide whether to reinstate the character and its player into their previous leadership position the character comes off NPC big a deal is becoming a A pretty big deal. We expect a great deal out of our leaders and there is a lot of responsibility involved. Leaders are given moderation powers over their pack’s forum, access to the private leader forum, and nearly limitless power to do as they will with their pack’s IC and OOC structure, contests and games, website, ranks, etc. Leaders do essentially run their own little enclave of ‘Souls members, and it’s important for leaders to be responsible, mature, and leaders have to be active?

Sinking All Alone', deep gurgle of running water slowly faded into hearing range as Zach walked through various strong smelling pine trees. The duff beneath his feet was soft and even sandy in places causing any sort of incline or slope to be quite a pain to scale. This, however, didn’t bother the ebony male too much. He had gone out to collect wood for trap making and now carried a backpack filled with plenty of different sized wood branches. He had nearly filled the pack and its weight didn’t help his travel but it meant he was nearly done with collecting the wood with plenty of daylight to go. Now he headed to the nearby river in to get a drink or even spend the excess time he had to bath. His fur had gone more than a week now without grooming and was quickly becoming less attractive than he’d like it to coming into view of the river all thoughts of grooming flew out the window. Emerald eyes were drawn through the crimson tint of his mask’s eye covers toward a strange male balanced atop a rock some distance out. With a rather thin looking spear in hand it appeared he was attempting to fish. Short thoughts of leaving without any interaction were the first to enter Zach’s mind as usual but by the look of this male he wasn’t taking very good care of himself. The hard-to-miss signs of starvation were visible which indicated that he likely had little luck fishing. It became clear soon enough that this was a valid observation as the male tumbled from his people would chuckle at the comical seen but Zach did not. This was due in part to his poor sense of humor but he also knew that a wolf who could not take care of himself was nothing to laugh about. This man was dying. Zach thought briefly to himself about this while the other male made his way toward shore. With a glance down to the pair of daggers at his hips Zach quickly realized something: he could save this man or, at the very least, give him the tools to fend for himself. If he could fend for himself depended on many things though that Zach couldn’t guess at with only a glance at him. But if the stranger could, the gift of this tool, of life itself, would be a good reason to be indebted to Zach. With the scars about his body it seemed clear this man was a survivor. A survivor could make a useful ally for this trait spoke of internal Zach believed the man could be of no use then he wouldn’t bother and could easily leave the man to die. But since he looked like he could be useful if he wasn’t starving it was a relatively easy decision. The masked male removed his backpack and set it on the forest’s floor. This left him wearing his bow, quiver, set of daggers, and mask. He then moved casually out of the forest to the river’s edge. He was a good thirty feet up river from the male, far enough that he figured the male would not feel threatened. He did not turn to acknowledge the stranger yet though. Instead, he drew his bow and a single arrow. Then he strung said arrow and stood for a minute, watching for a target and compensating for the slightly displaced image of the fish. Only a few moments later he let the arrow go. It sung though the air and splashed into the water. Zach marched into the river and retrieved his arrow which now had a wriggling fish on it. The fish was probably about five pounds but he couldn’t say what kind of fish it was. His prey stopped its wriggling soon after and he pulled the arrow from now caught, Zach finally turned toward the other male and approached him. Once in range he tossed the fish at the other male, shouldered his bow, and returned the arrow to its quiver. He then stood and watched the chocolate male. After a short pause he asked in a calm voice that likely clashed with his mask’s savage “What is your name, solid p p.ooc solid b '', '',

we''re hunting wabbits', It''s fine. Bit rambly, her small stature and average strength, Kiara was a veteran huntress. As an pure arctic wolf, she was fortunate enough to inherit her subspecies amazing endurance. Her thick neck and chest muscles as well as strong legs gave her the strength required to survive in the high arctic. She was gifted with speed that make her larger counterparts fall away in shame. Although Kiara could never take down anything of size on her own, she knew how to fully utilize her abilities in a pack hunt. Kiara had taken part in a countless number of hunts, most of the ones in her youth involved the vast herds of bison that made their home in her birth pack''s valley. Kiara was familiar with the tactics required for elk, deer, and other types of prey; but she excelled at bison was clear to the ivory mother that while Altair had taken after her and was set to become a fine hunter, Leela and Marrok seemed to have more trouble than she would have assumed. She couldn''t help but wonder if some of the blame was on her. Perhaps she should have taken the pups to more hunts, or worked with them closer to impart her knowledge of hunting onto them. They needed to learn how to hunt, and as much as she hated to admit it, become more independent. There was always a chance that her pups might be struck with the same affliction she had once possessed. If they felt the same need to travel as she had, they would need to know how to keep themselves fed. That was her job as their mother, and one that she took and embarrassment shrouded her son''s features as he stumbled through his explanation. Her gaze shifted to her son as she looked at his injured nose. Sure enough, there was a scratch on it. Kiara immediately began to fuss over the injury. no! Are you alright? How deep is it? We should go to the medical hut and have Fayne look at Her ears fell backwards as she gave the injury a quick sniff. It didn''t seem all that bad, but she simply couldn''t help herself. Marrok wasn''t even a year old yet, and despite the fact that he was already bigger than her, Kiara couldn''t help but see him as the infant he had once then and there, Kiara vowed to spend more time with all of her pups and teach them everything she knew about hunting. Lucia and Altair seemed to do well enough, but Leela and Marrok were desperate need of some lessons. If Marrok was getting injured by rabbits, she shuddered to think of what would happen if he went against something stronger. A kick from a deer could cripple a wolf and bison were know to kill canines. Without the ability to shift, all of her pups were at an automatic disadvantage when it came to strength and ability. Kiara didn''t necessarily want her pups to change, she knew life as a natural wolf was harder and far more dangerous. Their lives were shorter and even small injuries could mean the end. Although her pups were safer in New Dawn, Kiara could not allow the current situation to remain.

Passing references don''t require a mature marking; however, if the thread revolves around drug use, manufacturing, etc. it should be marked mature. Graphic depictions of or severely intoxicated characters do require a mature marking, content almost requires a mature marker.

Graphic sexual content may be played on the board, but it be properly content needs to be marked mature where it is gory or overly explicit.

NPCs', of NPC stands for Non-Player Character -- as opposed to a Player or Played There are various types of NPCs at ''Souls, ranging from to NPC perspectives may not appear alone in roleplay -- NPCs cannot be roleplayed except where it accompanies a played character''s are not permitted to control NPCs belonging to other players without permission -- this is akin to NPCs NPCs are radically different from all other NPCs. aNPCs are formerly active, played characters that have been but which still hang around pack territories. Placing an inactive character on aNPC status allows players to go on extended absences without having to come up with a reason for their character to leave and return ICly. aNPCs are presumed to be present and attending to their normal is to dropping a character -- you must adhere to and status is a privilege for pack characters only; cannot be placed on aNPC status (but may be assumed to remain around ''Souls playable be approved by your pack leader. Check with them for more information; different packs may have different guidelines regarding aNPCs, such as a maximum period of time a character can remain cannot be adoptable, as to be on absence they must already have a NPCs NPCs are to individual, active, played character. Every played character of ''Souls is entitled to a single canine cNPC. cNPCs are generally closely related (familial, friendship, mateship, etc.) to their attached character, but can be of any sort of relationship: a random follower, a found puppy, played character is allowed a maximum of one canine cNPC at any given characters joining without a cNPC may obtain one cNPCs are allowed character may have a several small animals (e.g., rats), a horse, and a cat. However, while a character that owns and maintains a single horse is realistic, a character that owns a herd of twenty horses without the assistance of other Luperci is not. Canine ghosts count as canines and therefore count as NPCs Youth NPC is any puppy born into ''Souls via our (in other words: not all puppies are yNPCs). yNPCs may remain attached to their parent(s) indefinitely, and do not count as the parent character''s of OOC ownership of a yNPC is by the player who contributed the point. For example, if Parent A contributed two points to a litter and Parent B contributed one, then Parent A owns two of the resulting puppies and Parent B owns can retain yNPC status in the absence of their parent(s) only when formally ICly adopted by a third party. In these cases, formal OOC ownership of the yNPC passes from the parent(s) to the adopting party. For example, if a puppy''s parent(s) die or leave the board without taking them with them, and the puppy is then formally adopted by another character -- the player of that character is the puppy''s new owner. It is acceptable for a pack to be the third party; ownership in such cases would be the current leadership of the the parent(s) are aNPC''d, their puppies are also NPCs (pNPCs) Board NPCs bNPCs and pNPCs are similar, but with a few key differences: namely, who owns the NPCs, and who can roleplay with them.

Major changes to a bNPC or pNPC are not permitted without the owner''s permission -- control pNPCs and bNPCs within reasonable limits. Major changes include, but are not limited to: killing, maiming, or otherwise injuring them; engaging in romantic, mateship, or child-begetting plots; engaging in plots which may cause major alteration of the character''s life, NPCs Pack NPCs belong to a pack. Any member of that particular pack may roleplay with the pack NPC freely. pNPC specifications differ by pack -- please check with your pack''s information or your leader(s). example, if the SuperAwesome pack has pNPC Bob, all members of the SuperAwesome pack are free to control Bob as a NPC. Phil, member of the Chicken pack, cannot roleplay with Bob unless he seeks special permission from the SuperAwesome pack''s NPCs Board NPCs belong to the ''Souls Assemblage.

Recurring minor NPCs are okay, but make sure not to abuse them and treat them as a post references a character having met a fur trader several times. Unacceptable: the fur trader shows up in active roleplay numerous times, and seems to exist only to do the player character''s clarification regarding NPCs (regardless of their adoption availability): all NPCs must have an active character attachment (i.e., be a Companion NPC to an active character) they must have an active pack attachment (i.e., be a Pack NPC within an active pack) they must be a youth NPC (i.e., born into ''Souls via puppy procedures).

Living on borrowed time', was only one thing worse than trying to kill a king, and that was failing to kill the king. The failed attempt at poisoning Kentaro had quickly reached Kohaku''s ears and the news made the Marbas feel nervous. He had agreed to help with the coup and overthrow Kentaro in favor of an older, wiser leader. Panda wasn''t a canine Kohaku really respected either, but the choice was better than their current king. However, the failed attempt might mean the end of their plans and perhaps their lives; or at the very least, their lives in was far from the leader Kohaku would have chosen to follow, even more so than the Angelo. The fact that both were younger than Kohaku made him want to spit. The young male''s accent grated on Kohaku''s ears and his haughty personality made the patchwork wolf want to strangle the monster. Kohaku only helped because he was bitter that Aeron had been thrown off her perch by Kentaro. If Kohaku was going to be honest with himself, the change in leadership didn''t bother him as much as he liked to think it did. With the failed assassination attempt and Viper''s accent becoming several shades of unbearable, Kohaku couldn''t help but question his decision to join the coup in the first original reason for joining Anathema was not only to protect Lucias from New Dawn, but to find a place where he could gain the skills necessary to avenge Amy''s death. What did it matter to him if Kentaro had become the new leader. He didn''t need to give his support or respect to anyone in the pack. Anathema was supposed to have been a means to an end, not a home. Joining the coup was a stupid idea, but Kohaku didn''t really want to accept Kentaro as the Marbas was working over the situation in his mind, the Angelo''s demanding howl called out to him and Isolde. Kentaro wanted a meeting and Kohaku''s cinnamon ears folded back until they rested on his ruff. With a sigh, Kohaku stood and moved to leave his room. He paused, turning back to see his gauntlets with the hidden blades inside. Emerald eyes held the gauntlets for a minute before he grabbed them and slipped the onto his arms and over his white cloak. It was the same outfit Aeron had granted him when he first became her student. Other than the hidden blades, Kohaku brought no other weapons. The gauntlets were only for his own protection. The last thing he wanted was to give Kentaro a premature reason to separate his head from his Kohaku arrived, he was greeting with a sick and tired version of the coyote he thought he knew. Kentaro was propped up in his bed, his hair slightly disheveled. However, the bite in Kentaro''s eyes was obvious and Kohaku wondered how much the Angelo knew about the coup. Kohaku remained in the doorway, his muscles tense and his jaw set as his emerald gaze scrutinized the younger male. font-family:georgia; b p auto; background-position:bottom center; background-repeat:no-repeat; solid font-family:georgia, sans-serif; text-align:justify; .ooc '', '',

You are free to roleplay the entirety of the pregnancy -- but the first part of it should be backdated. We think this will make things easier all-around: it makes puppy requests more similar to character requests and simplifies rejections as it removes any stress you guys may have about roleplaying a pregnancy for puppies you may have to have your character welcome your thoughts on this, as any other newspost! Did we get it right? Adoption Contracts and Character updated our procedures. Our default assumption, where it concerns absences, is now that adoptables can always be reclaimed by their original The vast majority of contracts stipulate this anyway, and we believe it will save some players time and hassle in digging up adoption contracts for characters that fell inactive quickly or have been inactive a long also note that still dictates long-term players should keep their If a player has put hundreds of posts and years of play into the adoptable, it is still widely considered rude to rehome those characters. The ''Souls Assemblage has never enforced this as a hard-line rule, though. Nonetheless, we did want to include a brief notice about this, as also like to note that you allowed to update your adoption even if your adoptable has an active player -- you just have to get the player to to your new If there''s no new agreement, the old contract sticks. We thought a reminder in this vein might help everyone stuck in adoptable situations with no or a very old like to say a sort of goodbye to who has stepped down from the ''Souls Assemblage to focus more on AniWaya and leadership.

He helped her with the shorts as her fingers fumbled on the unfamiliar trappings, and once the fastenings were undone, the fabric slipped free down his legs. She was quick to thrust forward, bumping their hips together in a playful guarantee of what was soon to come. Then his muzzle was at her throat, licking and even nibbling at her sensitive neckline. She tipped her head back and cried out, leaning heavily into his supporting arms as her knees buckled. He didn''t know what he was doing to her -- or rather, he knew all too easily what her weak points were, and she was helpless in his hands. She was trembling. grasp shifted, and Coli gave a squeak of surprise as he hoisted her up in his arms. She felt so very small like this, swept up like a brittle leaf in a storm gale. He had such strength beneath his plush coat of fur; she could feel his hard muscles, corded from his regimen of scouting, patrolling, hunting. Even if he wasn''t strong, though, he would never drop her. He managed to reply to her aloud then, brogue thick with feverish need. Coli giggled breathlessly as she touched noses with him, barely understanding his accent but enjoying his colorful words anyway. The rumble of his voice made her shiver against him, her legs wrapping around his midsection to keep them locked together with every step Nier took into the bedroom. found herself stroking his face, fondling his velvety ears as she reveled in the security of his embrace. She was lost in his rich blue eyes, the intensity of his stare making her fluttering heart quaver even more rapidly. There was so much promise in his gaze, a depth of limitless passion that spoke of so much more. Niernan was meant to love someone, he was never meant to be alone. Colibri was selfish to steal him for the night and promise nothing more, but she needed him to make her feel whole again. She would give him everything she had, every part of her, and maybe he would feel whole again too. sank onto the bedding together, the soft blankets and furs a luxurious backdrop compared to the hard chair. She was flushed and panting, driven so far by his caresses and kisses and the heat of his touch. She couldn''t possibly hold out any longer, drowning in the scent of his desire mingling with her own. She needed him now, or else the pressure would consume her. His lips pressed to hers again where they belonged, and she moaned, a wordless call of animal desire as she feverishly kissed him back. Her legs were splayed apart willingly, the pale cream fur exposed to his roving hands and everything else. His fingers curled around her slender waist, and her nimble hands traced down his soft chest fur, greedily clutching fistfuls of fur and yanking him closer. There was no turning back. Colibri awoke the next morning, she was in his arms. It was the feeling of safety, of comfort, that filtered through her senses first. Then gradually her blue eyes blinked, squinting at the pale morning sunlight filtering into the bedroom. At first she couldn''t quite remember how they had gotten to that point; her head ached from the alcohol, and the words they had spoken that night were a faraway haze. She had gone to see him, to make sure he was okay... and they had bared their souls to each other, in so many ways. His warmth was still engulfing her, their arms and legs tangled together in whatever position they had finally drifted to sleep in. Waking up in the arms of another... something she could only dream of. cheeks flushed beneath her fur as more of the details came resurfacing to her dazed mind. The things she said, gods, she had been like another person that night -- so brave, so in charge! Whatever it was had fled her now, though she lingered underneath his warm arm, wanting to remember the feeling. Niernan was her friend and she loved him as such, but they were not meant to be more than that. They had their children to think of, their duties, their age difference... this was just their loneliness seeking comfort anywhere it could find it. Oh... The puppies, they had left their children overnight at Saul and Lilin''s! Of course the Virdings would take care of them for a sleepover, but they had not promised any such thing, and it was only right for the parents to worry. She could not stay any longer. she wriggled free of the bed of furs, and made an attempt to smooth out the tangled mess of her mane, she shook Niernan awake. It was a simple enough explanation; they had to return to the real world, to all their responsibilities and isolation. He did not have any expectations of her, nor she him. It would be their little secret, one that would bring a shy little smile to her face whenever she was reminded of it. As she slipped out the door, still attempting to neaten her ruffled appearance, she caught sight of Ciaran and shot him an embarrassed look. That cat better not tell anyone what happened here.

Leaders are human; they roleplay and operate packs for the sheer fun of it. Their creating a pack and taking on all these duties gives you a fun place to We hope members take the opportunities presented in the Handbook -- i.e., a pretty well precise guideline as to how the packs operate -- and their rather than picking on leaders for not doing everything the Handbook describes precisely as it describes it exactly all the time. We think ''Souls community is awesome enough to do so much information to brand new members may intimidate We''ve thought of this, and we agree. There is no reason a guest or a registered user needs to see the Leader Handbook. It''s something that applies only to an actively roleplaying member. We''ve opted, therefore, to hide the Leader Handbook to Guests (i.e., those viewing the board while logged out) and Registered Users (i.e., those who have created an account, but do not belong to an active member group such as the Loners, the The Handbook still has the potential to intimidate -- but we''ve also added warnings to the forum description and header regarding the advanced nature of the topics, and how they apply only to leaders and those who hope to be leaders.

It''s a big Many of these ideas and questions regarding leadership we receive -- it seems the member has not considered the OOC aspects of leadership. Well, if the Handbook (the document detailing the OOC aspects of leadership) is private, how are they to know what it We feel publication of the Handbook will allow all members -- new and old -- a better idea of what leadership is all about, and whether that is really for them or not. Unfortunately, at ''Souls, it is not merely a matter of having an awesome character and roleplaying a badass boss. There''s a lot of OOC work involved, too, and we feel publicizing the Handbook is the best way to expose members to the expectations of will be more easily able to form It stinks forming a pack blindly. The two-application process and the private nature of the Leader''s Handbook currently forces a new member with no leadership experience to basically at what being a leader entails. This is bad on a few might put a lot of work into their pack idea, only to find some of their information, policies, etc. need to be is unrealistic of us as the ''SA to expect someone to submit a passing application without foreknowledge of the If we publish the Handbook, someone who wants to form a pack does not need to wait until they''ve submitted an application to see the Handbook. They''ll have a much better idea of leadership and how it works, and thus their process of application -- and actually their in its early stages -- will be much At present, we shove the Handbook at a leader after their first application is approved. This forces a new leader to go into crunch time mode. They must read and understand the whole huge Handbook push out their pack foundation requirements and information in the same brief time.

Lastly, some of the information in Pack Formation is relevant to Leaders, too (forcing them to look two separate places if they need to reference the Roleplay Information A small benefit, but a benefit nonetheless: the removal the Pack Formation document from the Roleplay Information forum is a good simplification.

The scattering of birds from the Dampwoods canopy had told the Scout that much, but it was the lack of scent on the breeze that made the woman''s mind uneasy.

It had been a passing moment away from her relentless, overnight patrol of the borders. Galilani didn''t like to sleep, and even though tiredness tickled the edges of her eyelids, the scout held her ground, and kept watch over the borders barely a hundred yards below. her Redwood bow in hand, and a spare tucked in the quiver upon her back, the Scout was not short on weapons. Even the knives sheathed to her thigh glittered in the daylight. Arrows rattled against one-another as she leaned breathlessly against a large rock, watching every flutter and scurry that occurred around her. The flurry of birds had put her on edge, naturally, but it was the low, canine bark that truly caught her attention. herself to a stand, the Aniwayan Scout gripped her bow with a tighter, firmer hand. With a few agile hops and skips down the embankment, she found herself quickly on flat ground and surrounded by the towering selection and shade of Ash, Ironwood and Elm. in deeply, with the taste of salt and warm earth upon her tongue, Galilani stared motionless through the trees. At first, she could see nothing; but upon closer inspection, a form came in to view, camouflaged by dark fur and darker leather. heart jumped in to her throat. As with previous meetings along the borders, Galilani felt a surge of anxiety and panic electrify her brain. Her spine and thighs tingled, as though ants had found their way into her skin. Her mouth felt dry, and her stomach twisted into nauseous knots upon itself. hard, fighting back a cough as the increasing humidity in the air burnt her tonsils, Galilani lifted her shoulders high, and her head higher. She gave the illusion of confidence, even if inside, she felt like curling up in to the tightest ball and fading into nothingness. Her clashing emotions; the determination to succeed combined with the ultimate fear of everything caused a whirlwind of confusion in the woman''s head. Her mind seemed to pulsate with the destructive panic attack, barging its way past her walls, and distorting everything. approached the chestnut coloured woman with apprehensive steps. They were slow, thoughtful steps; her mind racing with a hundred worries as to what this stranger might seek upon the borders of Aniwaya. She admired the saddled beast, and the ocean-painted blue jay. She took in every detail of the woman''s green leather attire; matching the shade to one not too far from the cotton loincloth she had wrapped around her own Galilani spoke in her native tongue; not so much out of habit, but out of nerves. She stuttered less, she found, when speaking in Cherokee, than when she spoke in English. However, deep down, the woman already knew that such a language would be of no use in this situation. English was the universal tongue in the land, and, unfortunately, Galilani was just as fluent in that as well. She repeated herself, standing a few feet from the woman. The scent was a muddle of earth and animal; there were no pack markers that the Scout could find. Her bow arm twitched, and her muscles rippled with the tightened grip of her palm against the wood.

This caused him to stumble as he landed on his muck-burdened paws, falling in such a way that his end of the stick jammed its way down his throat, eliciting several awful gagging noises from him before he gathered himself enough to pull himself off of it, coughing up a few bits of bark on the process.

Green eyes were closed, blocking them from the emotional blows that her mind wanted to gift her. Her attention was muddled, but carefully drawn out like a dislodged thorn, as a ritual was suggested. Immediately, another swell of excitement passed through the short hybrid, a grin spreading over her maw. Tonight, it wasn''t the place of the shadows to claim and feast off her fear; with this they would be scared away. Elody had performed her own rituals before; but none as diverse and effective as Panda''s. Flames licked towards the sky, burning like mad from the bounty of firewood laying around.

As it ended, she was relieved to hear of more magic. Later, but magic none the less. The cloaked hybrid walked back towards the table, inspecting whatever had been left there. Alcohol and food, some of the more lavish luxuries. Large ears perked slightly, Mido inquired about her thirst for the damn drinks. If not already relaxed enough, she could have yelled.

His pockets were heavy with wild cranberries, bilberries and his small collection of medicinal plants, carried wherever he went - aloe vera, elderberries, a tiny glass vial of honey, and even a small drawstring pouch full of cayenne peppers, now dry and slightly flattened with age. The ingredients slowed his pace, but it wasn''t very noticeable - the small Jackal was simply exploring, searching high and low for any useful plants. The cranberries would come in handy if anyone in Ani''Waya came down with a stomach illness, and he''d seen first-hand the importance of bilberries when you were short on acids like lemons. He was missing one thing, however, and he grinned when the tell-tale cry of his avian companion echoed out from over the crest of the Luperci swiftly made his way to the top, resisting the urge to cheer when he caught sight of Allard, the tiny kite crooning pridefully beside an empty nest, filled with minuscule eggs. Half of them were cracked, but they''d still be useful, and the Jackal kneeled next to the prize, petting Allard''s beak and feeding him a small lizard absentmindedly. His mind was enraptured by the eggs, and his brow furrowed at the thought of how to get them back to the tribe - they were so very delicate, after all... but they were important. The inner membrane of an egg could stop deathly bleeding in mere moments, and so, with a resigned sigh, Basil swiftly pulled off his cloak, wrapping the entire nest gently inside.

Grumpy yes, to some extent and especially when heckled by his mate, but the Captain was actually a closet softy, a real bleeding heart for the unfortunate and lost. He was unaware of the his true capacity to give comfort and offer the first bits of emotional healing, but something was happening in the crystal cave hidden beneath the lake, a sensation that brought his wiry fur on edge, but not necessarily in a threatening way. No, Gus was sensing something else, the feeling of being watched, but by something benign, and so, he just continued holding Storm close, offering what strength he could to the truth weary youth, prepared to hug him all night if need words had come from him or something else, the sounds of assurance leaving his mouth in a whisper that seemed to go straight through the male in his arms. Relief mixed with all the emotions he’d apparently been holding onto for all this time, just seemed to flow from the wolf in Gus’s arms, the Captain’s patient heart beating the time that escaped them as he allowed Storm to slink into a quiet and content daze. He could feel the tensing of muscles and bone when consciousness returned to the being in his grasp, and soon Storm was straightening back up, taking a step backward to have a bit of an eureka! moment. is that Gus joked, before the youth could engulf him in a bearhug again, causing the Captain to laugh slightly in alarm, though his arms eventually returned to their comfortable hold about him. not going anywhere he assured him, jawing moving above the other’s head as he chuckled once more. He listened without an ounce of judgement when Storm began to speak again, a little more sheepishly this time, but Gus kept giving him a friendly smile and a nod to prompt his words. laugh echoed about the cave when Storm’s rush of breath filled the air, an assuring squeeze given to his arm before Gus even began to speak. that intuitive feeling of being watched was starting to make sense now. believe in spirits, and I think your brother is keeping an eye on he said seriously, though his features remained warm and pleasant. he started addressing the cave in general, thankee for your brother, and I hope to do right by you in giving him a second chance in this life, as one of my own kin.

Lokr had the sensation of taking part in a wonderfully clever play, something a wordsmith had dreamed up. He wondered at their open and ill-concealed unease, and fed off of it, allowing the black smile that lingered foully about his sharp teeth to grow, and white female was certainly the dominant of the two, and she proved it again by answering him curtly. The clipped tone made light of her dislike, the civility that was wearing thin on her pleasantly angled features. As of yet, her companion had naught to be said - It occurred to Lokr that perhaps he was a guard-slave, for such things existed in their world and were hardly unusual. In fact, it would be rather practical of a handsome woman travelling alone to take such a subdued escort with his silence was not tactful - Maybe it was because he had no quick words, clearly meant to impress upon him the rudeness of his inquiries, did little of the sort.

There was no room for mistakes, now; Each pressing moment drew air from his lungs and a swell of anticipation from his pupils rose to the figure of Lillith, leading her strange and eclectic family into the long dining space - The red witch herself was regally garbed, and was trailed by the two young women born of Isabella''s womb. Each siren-daughter was resplendently dressed, though the elder was far more flagrant in her garb, and pale-throated Ondine was made to be a mild wallflower in Ambassador followed them. She was a master at the game - But it was in his blood as much as hers, and Lokr felt the sting of her gaze as it grazed him. He thought, perhaps, that the woman hoped to cut him apart with her stare. His black lips twitched at the was next to arrive, displaying her quiet feet and slinky movements to her advantage. A spy in the making, he was certain, even though her ivory pelt shone like silver moonlight in the shadows. Shortly after her arrival was Siv, and the room seemed to hush as the woman entered; the flamed dipped and flickered, and in the waxing light she was as beastly and immense as ever. In spite of his certainty, Lokr could not deny the air of that lingered about the large woman, and when her ethereal purple eyes lingered on him the young man''s expression was smooth as the wake of Siv''s entrance came Violeta, escorted by the ever-formidable form of her father. Though his garb was old and faded, the sunset-eyed man would always be regarded with wariness and respect; There was an unmistakable violence in his stillness, his quiet. The hidden snake struck the deadliest, and Lokr did not allow his gaze to linger on the girl with the pale cheeks and the one moon-masked subtle entrance was dashed by the appearance of Loki, whom with his usual aura of charm made short work of the assembled gathering. At Salvia''s shoulder, Lokr was able to see each reaction to the silvery man''s appearance - It did not take a genius to deduce that he was well-liked indeed. In truth, the man''s affable nature seemed slippery and false to the young dragon. Lokr had not forgotten their last private moment, and was not eager to repeat it. His nearness pervaded the strange scent that accompanied Siv''s son; Something feminine, something masculine, something altogether as Lokr unwillingly allowed it into his lungs. The silver man''s elegant fingers brushed high up on his collar, their nearness so close as to almost brush the dark one''s face; Lokr kept his alarm carefully concealed, and regarded Loki with unmistakable coldness. you He replied softly - And only exhaled once the witchson had moved to take his the unsettling time of Loki''s nearness, Lokr almost missed the entry of three others - The D''Aabt son, a quiet youth with pristine ivory fur and eyes that glowed like coals from his seat amongst the Family; Azucena, who made her way up to greet Salvia and himself, and voiced her polite commendations beauty puts me to shame, He murmured thankfully, and took a moment to rest one hand lightly on her son''s shoulder as they passed by); And the white behemoth, Salsola''s own personal Lokr did not hazard a glance at Basilaris'' chaotic gaze - He did not fear the man, for in his animalistic simpleness he seemed no thread to this game of political standing. But in spite of their apparent something about Salvia''s brother would always make him to arrive were his own niece and nephew. Though they were not tardy in their timing, for Salvia had yet to give her speech, Lokr sent each of them a keening look that said quicker, next time - I will not have you embarrass Even so, both Jezebel and Bacchus had dressed appropriately for the evening, and they took appropriate seats with all haste. He thought, in fact, that each looked rather civil in their garb, and was pleased to think that this would reflect well on him - Jezebel had all the gold-eyed beauty of his mother budding within her, and Bacchus was dark and elegant, intriguing as all his Revlis blood would allow there was no more time for silent watching. Salvia rose, and the long table fell to a respectable hush; Aft at her side, Lokr stiffened, and his gaze became hard and spoke in the regulated tones of a natural authority, and her voice commanded the attentions of all present - Lokr most of all, for he was her dedicated servant in all things, and his pupils were dark pinpricks in their mass of acidic green. The Queen''s voice rose and fell in crescendo with her words - She spoke of their trials, their tribulations, their triumphs.

It made her lonely at times, without a real sense of belonging. waited patiently while Palaydrian was in the store house, rubbing absently at the scars over her collarbone.

That was an experience all in itself, and Linden had eventually elected to not ride the hot-tempered stallion unless his father was around. It wasn’t that Drogon was a bad mount, merely that he did not listen to anyone but Linden Gunther was kept stabled, and it was here that Linden came to tack him up. This began with an unnecessarily detailed grooming process. Linden was not merely thorough but obsessively so—he curried and brushed Gunther from top to bottom, working out all of the dust and dirt that the horse managed to pick up while set out to pasture.

As soon as she finished transforming, she stretched her arms and legs, testing and enjoying the feel of her lean muscles. It was strange but liberating. She wobbled slightly when she stood, laughing at herself. she teased, wiggling her fingers in front of her two-toned eyes. Looking around with shifty eyes -- though the modesty was a playful farce -- Riot put a hand on her chest and even gave herself a friendly squeeze. were one of the odder things about this she didn''t necessarily feel naked when walking around on two legs rather than four, she nevertheless made a beeline for the old, abandoned camps within the defunct national park. She found what appeared to be an overgrown rubbish heap. Sifting through inches of dirt and debris -- and cutting her hand on a rusty soup can in the process -- she found a pair of tennis shoes. Like the one she''d found the other day, they pretty much crumbled in her hands. need shoes she thought, throwing the tatters over her shoulder as she continued foraging. It wasn''t like her feet would fit into them; even when bipedal, she still walked on her hand felt something buried in the heap. It was stiff but gave a little when she pressed against it. Wrapping both hands around it, she tugged and eventually yanked free an ancient, torn and mud-caked pair of jeans. They were stiff with grime, so she stood and beat them against her leg, coaxing some softness into the old denim. The label said which meant little to her. Riot held them against her waist, peering down to see that there were tears in the knees. Shrugging, she lifted a leg and stepped into them. They felt weird. They fit, though loosely, and she would need to find something to use as a them quickly, Riot folded them over one lithe arm and used a white toe to kick at the pile of debris, stirring the trash. There wasn''t anything else useful in there, so she began drifting around to other campsites. The coywolf couldn''t find anything suitable, so she decided she might see if the local packs might trade her something that she could use to hold up her pants. She wondered if they would accept game in exchange. Did they even keep supplies? Riot didn''t know how developed these canine civilizations were; she had yet to check them out personally. tired of her futile searching, Riot scouted out a creek and squatted on the bank, balancing gracefully on her dusty white toes. She dipped the old pair of jeans into the slow rapids and began to knead the grime out of the old cotton, watching as years'' worth of filth washed away in the clear water. Choppy pieces of hair kept falling into her eyes as she worked, which felt strange; she continously pushed them back. When she finished, she spread the pants out on the grass to dry in the sun, then shifted back into Lupus form and curled up beneath a tree nearby. As she closed her eyes and drowsed, she wondered if she could find a shirt or if she''d have to trade for that too. It would look pretty silly to wander around topless, wouldn''t it? she thought sleepily, deciding not to bother wearing the jeans until she''d found a shirt too.', '',

Her earthen eyes surveyed the land as the mulled over everything that had happened, a smile tugging on the corners of her lips until she remembered something. There had been one problem, while all of the drama heat had arrived weeks late. It was due before the last full moon and hadn’t come, which had worried the Beta. She could only attribute it to stress, and had worried even more about it, wondering if it meant she couldn’t have pups. But now, it was here, the scent was strong and all but filling the pack lands. She was a mated female, and the highest ranking female in the pack for that matter. Ciara no longer needed to hide her season. With a smirk she jumped off the den and swished her high tail, for some reason wanting to show it off to the other pack display would doubtlessly call to a few pack mates, but she hoped that it would mostly get her mate’s attention – it was time for them to create new life 'IACA', '', 
Open Characters', are encouraged to establish and terms for reclaiming adoptables -- e.g., terms for player inactivity, personality, pack membership, players do not set very clear terms. There is then a lot of ambiguity about the agreement. For example, basic agreements over AIM or PM can be open to all kinds of interpretation and argument later about what the character was supposed to do, what their was, etc. Players writing clearer terms for adoption leave less room for these that especially stringent contracts may also make adoptable characters less attractive to players looking to adopt. In general, we do definitely recommend giving adopting players freedom; part of roleplay''s fun comes from not controlling every single aspect of everything, after a player has violated an adoption contract and you wish to reclaim the is that if you created the character and adopted it out, inactivity is always a term for reclaiming.

He found himself listening without meaning to, green eyes buried in the book laid out at his feet, but large ears twitching as the harmony began to register in his head. It wasn''t long before he was humming along and not reading a single word his eyes scanned. Finally he looked up, tilting his head from side to side curiously before he left his book where it lay on the floor and trotted over it in his decision to investigate. four paws were light, claws almost soundless against the courthouse''s floors as he descended the steps. He peered through the banister railings, spotting a white figure at the piano.

After having been on her own for some time, and camped in places that were hardly permanent, Lily wanted to make this place a sanctuary where she could go to find peace and comfort. At the moment, the building was an empty shell that contained only the few things that Lily had carried with her as a loner.

Her firstborn daughter was leaving her, and while Shiloh had prepared for this, it didn''t make it hurt any less than the day Abigail had announced her intention to emerged from her house, her blonde hair wet and frizzled and in her face from the drizzle of rain. She pushed it back and attempted to control her features, refusing to let them crumple into grief. She needed to be strong for Abigail, to make her feel less like she was leaving something behind and more like she was off experience something new.

Abigail would have a relationship with her father and half-brothers, and Vinátta would always be there for her to come home watched as Abi stood out in the village, laden with her belongings, howling at last for her family.

Jérôme, who had been in the puppies'' lives from the beginning, a babysitter and uncle-like figure, limped down the path as quickly as he could manage with his injuries.

The male looked at her as her roving eyes took the boy in. She responded to the greeting, as customary for the culture of the two Salsolians, and once this was done, the male was told that it was wise that he did not use her punching bag without her permission. Viper''s intense gaze was held on the pale woman and his long tail flicked lightly behind him, a very subdued look passing over him, for he was a servant under her. His family had no power here, for the Trombetta witch had only been a Confident. His mother''s blood did not even run to here, so no one knew that he was really a prince, that he really was something than the folk. He continued to stare at the woman, his tongue coming to his lips as he nodded his head respectively, if not eagerly as she gave him the meager compliment. It was then that she asked him an odd question. One that he possibly did not know the right answer for. She asked if he liked the of fighting. The tall ears of the boy bent back and he turned his gaze from her to the punching bag. He thought that he liked the idea, but Viper did like to his way out of trouble when need be. He liked the of being able to defend himself if things got nasty. That was probably the more accurate thing to say, but also, Viper had the conundrum of wanting to become stronger than the ones who were in charge of him. Salvia, while he was loyalty to her, was no different in this case. Viper wanted position. He belonged in a throne one day, and that day could not come soon enough for the stolen prince.

She''s promised he would not see her again, but that had been a lie. She had never been able to stay away from this place too was a small pang of guilt over that, but necessity had won out. A mother she was not, children were too fragile, too much of a commitment for her to manage and she saw it better to dispose of the girl, before she grew attached, before she gave the child a name and saw her as her own. Along these familiar borders however, she wondered how her three children were; if they were still all residing here or had they moved on with their own lives? Rubbing large hands over her face, she sighed, knowing that what she was about to do would not go down well and that was likely putting it then again, when had she ever cared for the opinion of others.

It was possible, she supposed. She knew a lot of things were possible when the insanity crept into your brain.

It brought back memories she thought she had dealt with entirely so she could move on, but this fight caused them to surface again. On one hand, she was able to keep her focus to fight Elias enough until the others came, but on the other she struggled with her memories and unanswered questions as to her brothers betrayal. It fueled her fight to defend her packmate. Rhiannon let out another howl again to signal to others who were possibly on their way that the fight had begun and the need to remove Storm became more necessary as he still hadn''t moved.

The series of caves harbour some of the best preserved documents, hand-made trinkets and odd knick-knacks possessed by the pack. Several small and scattered islands become visible a short ways off-shore, under-water hills peaking up from beneath the sea to greet the denizens of the beach. The crowns of these hills are smoothed and slippery rock, making them dangerous to tread upon, and thus a hazard to the curious who would dare to try. height: scrolling: in the heart of mountains, resting between two of the larger peaks, lies a set of interconnected caverns that have stood the test of time. There are multiple entrances, some barely large enough for a rabbit, but the most prominent ones are two gaping holes on the rock face nearly fifteen feet high. Just within the mouth of the cave all light disappears and the darkness is absolute. If lit artificially, however, the stone is a pale golden-yellow, rough with crumbling rocks The caves continue on for miles, up as well as down, and it is easy to get lost in the labyrinth. During strong winds, a shrill howl sounds through each of the caves, amongst all the tiny cracks and gaping holes, giving the Howling Caverns its height: scrolling: similar labyrinth can be found in the Stellarton Mines, on the far western end of the mountain. Humans gouged deep into the mountain, creating long and deep tunnels that were in use until the virus struck. Although most of the mine shafts are horizontal, there are a few instances of sharp vertical drops that required the use of elevators--elevators which have long since ceased being used. Of course, there is no natural light in the deeper parts of the mine either. Even with light though, canines are advised to tread very carefully, as a fall into a vertical mineshaft is certain doom -- if the fall itself isn''t fatal, there isn''t a way back up and out of the height: scrolling: the foot of Halcyon Mountain are what the wolves of the surrounding areas have dubbed or more precisely, Phosphagos Foothills. A series of hillocks lines the base of the mountain, the inclines of each grassy knoll diminishing the further it rests from the base of the great rise. The plant life is fairly uniform in the foothills, tall grasses and small flowers mark the beginning of the ascent up the territory''s only mountain range. In the evening, the foothills are overshadowed by the tall trees and mountain itself, thus casting long shadows across the area. Dubbed the ''light-eating'' foothills, its name is a rough translation, combining the words ''phos:'' light, and ''phago:'' I '', '',

It has a climate similar to New Brunswick, though it suffers a coastal woe. In winter especially, the area is prone to fierce snowstorms and blizzards.

The city sits on a large bay of the Northumberland Strait, boasting various marinas and ports -- the largest of which houses three beached cruise ships.

Much of the suburban areas consist of multi-floor, sprawling Victorian houses -- though they are in poor condition thanks to the island''s on the height: scrolling: The Cavendish Estates consist of both a sprawling piece of farmland and the second-largest town on the island. The Estates themselves are a sprawling farmland, once used to grow a wide variety of foods. Many of them can still be found growing, though the neat rows of planting have long since fallen into disarray. The town is low-slung and clustered around the two processing plants, boasting a racetrack and several decaying bars as primary entertainment. The sprawling complex''s buildings tower above the housing, ominous and strange. Though not entirely unpleasant, the Cavendish Estates are a strange place for many on the height: scrolling: Cabot Beach is one of the most beautiful areas of Prince Edward Island. White sands and long, wide beaches characterize the shoreline, while the inland areas are thick forest plentiful with deer and other prey animals. Although beautiful, this area of the island is unsettling. Clearly colonized by Luperci, Cabot Beach was discovered completely deserted save one starving, maddened canine. Signs of Luperci inhabitance -- but no Luperci -- were found by the first explorers of the area. A lack of struggle or bodies precludes war as the cause for depopulation; explanations for abandonment are plenitful, but none certain. Ghostly mystery has permeated Cabot Beach ever on the height: scrolling: The North Wildwood arm of Prince Edward Island is remote. Consisting of pristine beaches, marshland, and sparse forest, the area is as beautiful as it is difficult to access. Despite its distance from the mainland and difficulty of access, Luperci may find the area a plentiful resource. North Wildwood is home to an abundance of wild horses -- there are no fewer than five herds of ten to fifteen horses each roaming the hilly, sparsely forested area outside of the town. More surprising is their quality -- the horses are said to be descendants of the mounted police in the area, as well as those raced in the town of Cavendish Estates.

Mostly he left only as a kept busy bled into exhausting nights, because as much energy he expended training or patrolling, he always had more to give in the face of his voracious sister, whose appetite for this was surpassed only by his own intense reserves of energy. It was amazing, he found, all the things he could do and not tire of it. His own body surprised him. too much of Dullahan''s time had been spent worrying about things he could no longer change. Osrath too, had threatened him before that continuing to see Peregrine foreshadowed a withholding of her own affections, but in the end of things he was as much a drug to her as she was to him; the locomotion of it all had already trapped them both. he lie there on his back, expectant and calm, not doing any particular thinking except to actively keep an ear for her return. And when she did, she smelled of horses, and of him. eyes rolled in his head, drifting from a familiar ceiling to an even more familiar face, and her rang in his head like a dinner bell to which he did not immediately heed. Pale hands came from beneath his dark, spiky head, and his lip curled in distaste for her suggestion. In a quick, fluid motion, he had grabbed her, and grappled the young woman further onto the bed, eventually wresting her beneath him, and pressing her down in the only way he ever sought to dominate her. just as she had come to be resolute in her own strength, Dullahan had grown twice as strong. His arms were trained to wield long, heavy weapons with grace and precision, and he treated the one between his legs much the same way when he was slaying the beast that was his own sister.

The shoreline isn''t quite so harsh as the bay shoreline, nor so foreboding as the Atlantic Shoreline. Grey Seals make their home along this coastline, providing an ample meal for a Luperci devious enough to catch one. In all months but winter, a few species of whale are found in these waters, using them for breeding in summer.

Although a few tiny towns once existed within the fertile valley during the time of the humans, they have since fallen to complete ruin -- the only evidence of their existence is the occasional still-standing foundation of a house, or a pile of rotting wood.

Some greenery and evidence of life shows during the spring and summer months, but even this is sparse and stunted as the area struggles for its recovery.

Most of the trees here fell during the initial fire and have begun to rot away; saplings can be seen here, and although the land seems strangely flat and bare, there is evidence of green, returning life.

But also, I''m not really okay with leaders using pNPC status as a temporary thing that''s essentially aNPC status with powerplaying, and feel like pNPC status should be a more permanent deal since it is, essentially, the gifting of a character to a pack more than it is the pack keeping it around to be nice (or ought to be). I''m okay with leaders giving them back to original players and all and don''t necessarily want to bar it altogether, but I''m not sure I''m okay with it being systematic in the way ND does it; it goes against the essence of a pNPC, really. Also, if it''s that important to ND that absences are on NPC status rather than drops, nothing''s stopping them from expanding the aNPC time from just a single month instead of jumping into pNPC issues? I''m confused about what they hope to achieve, I was mentioned in PM. No extra information is given to suggest that this is ND''s local is a more risky choice, because it means your character is at the mercy of the other pack-members, and ultimately, can be injured, killed, or otherwise changed from what you originally or shortened sort of.

She absolutely hated having to be strict with them, but it was a lesson that needed to be taught. Pack mates couldn’t act this way towards each other, and all instances like this needed to be solved quickly – it was best for the health of the pack. She assumed that her demand of apologies would not be well received by the two young ones, and she was very right about that. The look on Saki’s face was less than pleased, and Keylo’s expression mirrored though, Saki put her chin up and apologized. At first the little growl wasn’t enough and Ciara was about to reprimand her, but soon she pride aside and gave an almost genuine apology. Ciara knew that Keylo’s words had hurt the girl, and she was very disappointed in the little prince, young as he was, for making such a comment…but they would all move past it.

With Arms Wide Open', Glancing back at her brother as she opened the door to the basement, she smiled fondly to herself watching him as he moved towards the hearth. Pulling the door to a crack behind her, Kenna fumbled a moment for the matches that she knew lay on a small side table at the head of the stairs. Finding the small packet, she struck a flame into existence, blinking in the sudden brightness. Lighting a candle which she''d grabbed off the kitchen table, Kenna slowly made her way down into the darkness. Her mind wandered back upstairs to Rowan and how much he seemed to know about her already. She found it a little unfair that he knew so much of her when she knew so little of him. He knew a lot of her quirks and secrets already as it was. but I''d enjoy getting to know the ones I don''t His playful voice echoed in her head and she smirked softly. She waasn''t sure what more there would be to reveal to him. Idly, she wondered if he''d really be surprised if she told him just where her thoughts had been going as of late when it came to him. She still felt a little awkward about her secret attraction, they were related! But somehow, with each passing moment, that small factor was becoming less and less important. When her paws hit the cold stone floor, she brought her mind back to the task at hand. Crossing to the corner of the room to where the wood pile was she grabbed up a few cut branches. The collie-woman then balanced the candle on top of the pile and started back up the stairway. Placing the candle on the table and blowing out the flame she swished her paw through the air to disperse the smoke. Leaning into the door with her hip, the basement door creaked open with ease as she slipped through it and back into the living the door shut with her foot, Kenna turned back to face the room. know Rowan, I really hope you''ll find yourself at home Suddenly, with a gasp of surprise, the wood she''d gathered clattered to the floor, a piece rolling under the couch as she spotted the purple flames crackling brightly in the fireplace. Blinking in shock and awe she stuttered softly to her brother who didn''t seem concerned at all, but rather a little amused. y--? She gave her sibling a quizzical look before slowly moving closer to the flames, eyes wide and mesmerized, mouth slightly agape in awe. She whispered, a whimsical smile spreading across her face. Looking down where he sat on the hearth, her eyes softened from their initial surprise and her tail wagged gently. figured you weren''t a stranger to fire, considering your brand...but I never expected you to be so artistic with Her voice was soft and a low murr rose in her chest. Glancing back into the dancing violet flames, a sudden warmth crested inside her. It had nothing to do with the heat of the fire before her. Slowly, as if transfixed by the colorful display, Kenna kneeled beside her sibling, the wood she''d gathered all but Her voice was suddenly strained. Kenna''s blue eyes suddenly met with his gold ones. The flickering flames danced within her eyes as well as something else, something more. Before any second thoughts could cross her mind and stop her, Kenna leaned forward, placing her paws on either side of Rowan and pressed her muzzle to his in a deep, tender kiss. Her eyes remained closed, her ears splayed back and as she slowly withdrew, a shocked, then sheepish expression came to her face. so She said quietly, mortified, starting to move away. don''t know what came over Embarrassment rolled off of her in waves as she bit her bottom lip and looked away, unable to believe what she''d just done.', '',

Leadership Survey Answer Key', font-weight:bold; General A common theme in many provided answers was to approach the player yourself. While it is absolutely true in many minor situations issues of powerplay, realism, etc.) we prefer members at large (not just leaders!) to try and settle grievances first, it is very important to alert the ''Souls Assemblage regarding any sort of infraction against board Even if we don''t need to intervene, it''s still important for us to keep tabs over any potential issues that may Azazel joined your pack a week ago. He is doing things that are not realistic to your pack''s culture and are two separate issues here: those of and those of Issues of are the typically the jurisdiction of the ''Souls Assemblage and perhaps the moderation team. However -- very minor issues of realism can be dealt with by leaders. If, for example, what Azazel is doing isn''t necessarily unrealistic for ''Souls, but unrealistic for your pack''s culture, that''s certainly something you can deal with as a issue of is definitely leader''s jurisdiction -- to be perfectly blunt, the ''SA doesn''t really want to hear about these types of issues a player becomes unruly, uncooperative, or even hostile in your interactions with them you feel uncomfortable approaching a particular player or a particular situation. We are always available to help in either of these cases, but leaders should also be able to enforce their own pack''s culture within their jurisdiction. for what you a PM to the ''Souls Assemblage regarding realism issues, providing samples and links to relevant a friendly PM to Azazel about his pack-realism issues. Make sure to relevant laws and customs, link to a page on the possible consequences of Azazel''s continued behavior -- will they be kicked out of the pack? Lose rank? Get beaten up by the Alpha? Make your leader character has IC precedent for discovering the behavior -- you cannot punish a character''s thoughts (for an extreme example); conversely, if a character takes strong efforts to conceal their behavior, may be overstepping your leader jurisdiction and possibly even metagaming. Consider the player can do to rectify their behavior, if they wish to avoid the Baphomet, a long-time member who has contributed to the pack in many ways and has also shown strong and consistent activity, asks you to consider promoting them to leadership. They''re polite and provide examples of what they''ve done for the pack. There is no answer here: this is essentially what you want to do. In the past, the ''SA has had strong dislike of asking (or hints, or suggests, or makes mention of their want) for a position. Those who work hard and have the appropriate attitude and work ethic for leadership, moderatorship, etc. will achieve it by the merit of what they do and how they behave.

This tests their ability to cope with the tasks. If they are to your liking, you might consider offering them a sub-leader position, but not before PM''ing the ''SA to get the green light first. This is the easy-going may wish to tell them you aren''t interested in having a co-leader who asks for their position, but you may consider them in the future.

Do you have a policy, requiring members to help their pack in some your pack have policies, you can PM them to offer help in case they need it, and let them know when contests and events are going on.

However, if you are including any sort of with this PM (outside of help and suggestions, that is) we recommend instituting an official policy by which to abide in cases of low activity members: make sure you''re enforcing any policies, consequences, etc. in a fair way across all your membership and make sure it''s clearly outlined on your website. Oriax might feel blindsided by the policy, or they may feel as if they are being singled out and your pack policies, this depends on your rules. You as a leader, enforce very strict activity requirements: for example, there''s nothing in our rules preventing you from instituting a posts per policy, which includes a boot from the pack after a single day of missing the post mark. Of course, we strongly recommend against such stringent activity policies: it is unlikely many current players at ''Souls will be able to keep to such activity requirements, and it''s also going to be extremely time-consuming for you check your pack every day and fairly enforce such general, we recommend leniency and a warning: them to offer help and let them know about but also make it clear (with a link to the relevant policy on your website) they must begin contributing to your pack or they may face consequences (let them know what those consequences are, if your website does not make it Azazel, the new member, has posted in a private thread (not meant for them) on your packlands.

There is no right answer as to what to do here. If Arete personally wronged your pack (e.g., taking pack graphics and reusing them elsewhere for another RPG or a related offense) you''re perfectly within your jurisdiction to turn her away from your pack. However, remember that the ''SA punishes players swiftly and universally when they''re caught stealing art, and most everyone learns the first time around. The player may feel particularly prosecuted and as if they''re continuing to be shamed for an event in the past (however recent). While we feel it would be best to allow the matter to pass, it is your jurisdiction as a leader to accept or reject players from your pack at will -- for any reason or no reason at you choose to reject her, we Arete and letting her know you plan to reject her character. It may come as a shock to the character''s player to be rejected, and this gives them some forewarning -- they may wish to simply back out of the thread and OOCly conclude it, and that should be fine. it bothers you personally to OOC end threads or you''d prefer to roleplay the end of this thread, you request continuation, but remember not to be rude, pushy, etc. If they''re adamant about walking away, it''s better to just let it Arete plans to pretend the thread never happened, this be an issue for the ''SA, depending. Their character could just look like a crazy ass, too, claiming to have never been somewhere and gotten rejected, so... it depends on the situation, essentially. c; If the player raises a stink about it or becomes hostile over the matter, etc., it''s definitely a matter for the ''SA, but if they''re simply pretending in la-la land it never happened, it''s not that big of a discreet and respectful.

If they refuse or do not respond in a timely manner, escalate the matter to the ''Souls they''ve replied to your PM or edited their post, let the ''SA know. We prefer to be alerted about all issues of powerplay, though if a player has corrected themselves we do not Exceptions to this include players with previous instances of powerplay (e.g., someone who you have spoken to before about powerplay, or someone who another leader has mentioned as having had powerplay issues), severe powerplay (e.g., the player has your character actually appearing in the thread like an NPC), or powerplay requiring any sort of retconning (e.g., the player has powerplayed killing your character in a thread). infractions should always go to the Oriax, the low-activity member, has recently began to post more frequently.

Remember to let members have their fun, the other pack''s leadership and try to ask what kind of outcomes they might want from the plot. If an agreement can be reached wherein all parties are satisfied, the plot should be allowed to move forward. If it appears resolution is impossible, the ''SA can be asked to Arete, a recurring member, has posted a joining thread to your pack for the fourth time. They usually stay active for about a month before they leave the board again, and rejoin at a later is no correct answer here. Leaders can accept or reject members as they please, for reasons as they please. See for suggestions as to what to do when rejecting a member. We suggest PMing them, detailing why they will be rejected. If you are open to accepting them again if they improve and become more stable, remember to say like activity requirements in we suggest clearly outlining policies for players who repeatedly join and quit the pack (if applicable) and enforcement, that you reject a who returns with different characters (e.g., Arete has played Jackal, Wolf, Coyote in your pack before and is now playing Dog). Your character obviously does not know it''s the same player coming back, so you''ll have to figure out an In Character reason as to why the new character ought to be you plan to allow a player admittance to your pack (or only at such time as they prove themselves capable of remaining we recommend PMing them and letting them know upon rejecting them: this way, they will not attempt to join your pack anymore (and if they do, they''re well-aware of what Azazel, the new member, engages in a plot that could upset the peace between your pack and another. Their plot involves only one other low-ranking canine of the other pack. Azazel did not message you before beginning this plot, and the other canine involved did not message their leader about this as per the Leader Handbook''s member plots should be accepted, provided the member adheres to IC consequence. The only difference between this question and is the members'' lack of communication regarding the plot -- it may show a lack of understanding or even outright disrespect on the new member''s part. we don''t have any hard-line rules on members who fail to speak to leaders about plots that upset pack balances, territory claims, etc. etc. In situations where a member repeatedly disrespects the leadership of their pack(s) by failing to discuss plots, the ''SA may enact consequences on a case-by-case basis, but other than politely reminding the member about etiquette and letting the ''SA know if the member becomes hostile, there isn''t much you can Tyrion, the long-time member, roleplays that they have damaged or changed a building or a of significance in your packlands'' territories.

In instances such as these, the ''SA typically asks members to edit their posts and remove any references to major territory lock the thread(s) except in an instance of severe and extreme powerplay (e.g., a member starts several threads at once by playing with dates, all of which are related to a fire destroying an important locale in the pack; several members of your pack seem to be spreeing these threads quickly between themselves). threads is not a typical part of the leader''s jurisdiction -- any issue which requires a lock should go to a moderator or the Atnas, the loner, posts an all-welcome thread in your exact situation is not against there''s nothing against the rules here. If your pack stringently enforces trespassing procedure, you may wish to enter the thread yourself, encourage members to enter the thread and chase the member off (Twitter is acceptable within reason -- looks like someone forgot Salsola''s trespasser procedures... c; is okay, Atnas doesn''t know Salsola enslaves trespassers! GET HIM! is not), thread be against our trespassing procedures if Atnas''s thread references being within the packlands for a significant amount of time, unmolested -- it is not realistic and may even be powerplay for Atnas assumes no packmember has encountered him.

Feel free to start topics in the Leadership forum to discuss other issues or to contribute your own (Leadership versus Administrative important to remember: leaders are not part of ''Souls game staff (the ''Souls Assemblage, Moderators). As leaders are given free reign and near complete control of their own packs, it can be difficult to determine where leader authority you''re not sure whether something falls under your jurisdiction as a leader, ask yourself whether or not a game-wide rule or procedure was broken. If the answer is yes -- or if you''re not sure -- the ''Souls and ask before taking action!

We''re here to assist you and we should be made aware of member issues versus OOC have a tough time when it comes to IC and OOC. Unlike a moderator or administrator position, a leader''s authority exists both IC and OOC. However, a leader''s OOC and IC jurisdiction exists only within their own pack. OOC jurisdiction is also not absolute even within one''s Law and authority is absolute. While you can set IC laws, you cannot enforce them The Bloodriver pack has ICly enforced laws regarding celibacy. Even so, the player of Azazel (the leader character) ban mature threads on the packlands. It is not an appropriate use of Leaders'' authority to move mature threads or create a preemptive ban on mature generally may not create added OOC prohibitions on members; ''Souls game-wide rules and prohibitions are Board-Wide are several exceptions where leaders increase or decrease OOC rules and regulations according to their can alter these to be strict than the board-wide rules (e.g., allowing some minor incidents of deep territory trespassing, allowing all members of another pack to come and go as part of an alliance, strictness cannot be enforced: banning all trespassing a mile beyond a pack''s defined border and enforcing that rule OOCly is not acceptable (OOC enforcement). Of course, having patrol a mile (or several!) beyond the borders is acceptable (IC NPC cannot change policies relevant to the board-wide aNPC procedures. Leaders can, however, set more specific policies such as limiting length of aNPC status, or even barring aNPC status can set many restrictions on pNPCs, including the type of roleplay pNPCs can be used for, plots pNPCs are eligible for, and so forth. The requirement of a pNPC is that they be freely useable in roleplay in some way. You would not be able to say, for example, is a pNPC but only are allowed to roleplay with That''s not a pNPC anymore -- they should be available for any member to are free to strictless in cNPC policies (e.g., barring a cNPC from joining after the fact, or barring cNPCs altogether).

That is, your character can do as they please with regards to membership, culture, members, In Character a very good idea to write clear and concise guidelines regarding your IC policies for various situations -- i.e., trespassers, joiners who trespass, visitors to the pack, etc. Display these guidelines on a or similar section of your '', '', 
Encountered a leader, you should remember to be flexible. If you are overbearing and overstrict, you absolutely run a risk of alienating members. They''ll then avoid joining your pack -- or, worse, they''ll think all of ''Souls is inflexible and (not to be harsh, but disallowing member plots isn''t very much fun to them!) and they''ll leave even ''Souls rules are concerned, the ''SA is flexible enough to allow some slight instances of rule bending if a player has made an honest or genuine mistake. There are numerous situations where we are flexible -- i.e., for puppy procedures, players with many characters may be granted a fourth point per year if they are exceptionally active. As a leader, you should strive to keep this in mind -- it''s very important you are flexible OOCly in allowing members to have their fun while easy for leaders to get overloaded by threads. Many members will want to seek your character(s) out. While you should always respond kindly to member PMs, you will want to avoid saying yes to every thread request that comes your way. After all, overloading yourself leaves less room for pack plot threads and mandatory pack threads, and can also eat into the time you should be dedicating OOCly as a leader, as be afraid to be up front with members when they do need a thread with you. Telling them you can''t right now is better than accepting the thread and falling behind everywhere. If you clearly state your reasons as to why you can''t thread right now -- whether that''s time constraint, too many threads already, or real life commitments -- they should be understanding and they can always come back to you later, or seek out a subleader, or find an alternative to their In Character duties of the pack are concerned, you may want to consider delegating them to members. For example, structure your ranks and co-ranks so that members will have to perform tasks essential to the pack rather than the leaders. You can consider scout ranks, especially -- if you want to trust these scouts to accept In Character joiners, that''s fine and will help you avoid joining threads, often considered a tedious part of where the leadership ranks are concerned, you may encounter members who seem to be for leadership -- whether that''s outright asking for leadership OOCly, or their character displaying a desire for leadership players who simply express a desire for leadership without assisting on some of the OOC aspects of the pack are considered ill-suited for leading. They may not know all that leadership entails, and it''s important for you to respond appropriately to an outright query regarding a leadership position. This is why it''s also important to clearly outline your own expectations for leadership, both the OOC player and the IC your response, you can then point toward your own guidelines, and perhaps illustrate some areas where the player is lacking -- it is very important to be tactful and respectful. You may wish to highlight the player''s strengths after getting into their weaknesses -- if they''re not very helpful OOCly, tell them where they can help you out and see if they''re any good at it. If they''re not very active ICly, tell them they must show some dedication to the site prior to accepting a leadership position. Tell them the size of the leaders'' handbook in ''Souls, and how extensive it is, and how many responsibilities they''re really asking to take pack can be harsh with trespassers -- you can absolutely set forth a policy of your pack-members to attack trespassers on sight, to drive them off the pack, etc. Of course, it is up to the individual character to enforce this -- some characters might not be comfortable attacking others, still others may choose not to enforce the IC laws regarding trespassers at all -- of course, should your leader character find out about this, you may enact IC consequences with set policies, you should still take steps to remedy trespassing situations as they occur. If a trespasser is breaking the regarding trespassing, you are within your right as a leader to politely ask them to adhere to game procedure. If they do not fix their post or thread to adhere to game procedure, it is a matter for the ''Souls Assemblage to evaluate -- send a PM and let us know what''s going that some new players aren''t familiar with ''Souls -- it''s a very good idea to PM newer members and let them know what they''re doing is wrong before stepping in ICly. They may change their post, or they may think it''s fun to be caught trespassing on pack territory and roleplaying it out! React appropriately to what the roleplayer seems to want to they do wish to continue trespassing while adhering to game procedure, you can then step into their all welcome thread as a leader (or even direct your pack-members to do are still ways for members to become repetitive trespassers, of course, which can be aggravating; however, provided they are adhering to the game procedures, this is acceptable. You can react appropriately, however, with some IC consequence: if the character is a repetitive offender, it is entirely possible characters from your pack would begin to recognize that character''s scent. As a leader, your character could call an In Character meeting about the trespasser to gather any information about them and inform packmembers they are forbidden from associating with that member; thereafter, any member of the pack who closely associates with the trespasser could conceivably be removed from the rank listings and made a Loner via ejection from the '', '',

Tayui felt like her life had been a strange whirlwhind of sudden occurrences and surprises. She was happy to have Auguste back, but still wondered why had had left in the first place. She had always known that he was quieter than the rest of his siblings, but they weren''t all that bad. Certainly, Carya was rambunctious, Andira was outgoing, and Valérian was curious -- but she didn''t think their personalities had to clash much. She still fretted over whether this was her or Anu''s fault. And worse, she seethed when she thought how one of Colibri''s girls had permitted him to remain in New Dawn without telling them. She held more of the responsibility than Auguste did. Given his age, she had suspected he had ventured out on his own, but it had quickly become clear that he had left on his own more than ever, she wished that she could return home.

We''ve listed the possible pages and what kind of information to include in approximate order of is a guide to suggested information regarding OOC policies, etc. Note that the culture section is rather sparse -- you should be in charge of incorporating culture for your pack, although there are some tips below when thinking about phrasing for your culture should list a bit of basic information about your pack -- mirroring information from the Pack is rather you use Twitter, reflect your Twitter feed on the index. You can use a Javascript widget as provided by Twitter themselves, or you can use the very same simple code we use to call to Twitter on the announcements contacts are great to list prominently somewhere on the index a link to your map. Embedding the map at a small size and allowing members to click to enlarge is probably best; you want your map to be a list of subterritories and their descriptions. You should be descriptive in these, but try to balance your informational overload, Obviously, most ranks pages have a list of ranks and their descriptions (i.e., their duties, position within the hierarchy, and how they can move up or down in the hierarchy). It''s good to note how many members you''d like within a particular rank, though you can also be flexible about this, and If you have a brief policy on this (e.g., you''re purely by post count or activity and the means are the same for every member), it might be better to just list it on the In contrast, if you have a long list of requirements for people to move up in ranks, it''s better suited to the ranks page on its own and It''s a good idea to pay special care to the leadership section of your ranks and clearly explain your expectations for any subleaders you may take on. Sometimes members (both long-term and newcomers) are especially eager to get into the leadership ranks. While this will not completely alleviate the issue of members, when members don''t adhere to your guidelines and ask about leadership and promotions, you can clearly point out why they''re currently ineligible for leadership -- if you get lucky enough, they may actually improve upon those If your pack has numerous Co-Ranks, you may wish to give them their own page or sub-page. In contrast, if you only have a few Co-Ranks, it''s good to keep things simple and include them as a subsection of your ranks page (unless your ranks are, in contrast, extremely hefty or This information should be at the top of the page and prominently listed. Please embed an anchor link to your joining information so it can be easily linked to from the forum index and other pages.

If your pack has a complex method of joining, consider splitting this information off onto a separate If you don''t list promotion and demotion information on your list it here. It''s good to give a brief summary of the ranks policies here and link to the more extended guidelines on the ranks page, if that''s the Again, if this information isn''t reflected on your ranks page, you should detail how members are expected to achieve Co-Ranks and what they are supposed to do once they''ve met the achivements for a particular It''s good to let your members know how and where they can claim to live on pack territory -- for example, you might choose to restrict a particular part of the pack''s territory for hunting only, or perhaps the pack lives in a village or other area. It''s good not to require characters live in a certain area, as offering members choice is good. Some packs even charge game points for claiming a residence on pack territory -- this is good to insure that characters don''t show up, take up a cave or other den, and promptly Detail your pack''s policies regarding NPC status. Do you approve NPC status at all as a leader? If you do choose to allow NPC status, do you impose time restrictions? Does a member have to have a certain amount of time within the pack as a member already before you will grant NPC status? For what reasons will you allow or deny a NPC What are your pack policies regarding NPC companions? While all players are allowed to have one canine NPC companion, you may choose to require that members write a read-only thread for their NPC companion to join the Let members know how often you expect them to participate in mandatory threads and what the punishment is for not attending a mandatory thread. For example, will a character be kicked out of the pack for failure to attend, or will they simply receive a If you do not list this information along with your game, you should absolutely let members know when and how they should submit their game and If you have scout ranks, are they allowed to accept members? When should a potential member be turned away, if you allow scouts to make this Culture page should be quite hefty, detailing your pack''s IC attitudes, beliefs, traditions, IC laws, and so on and so forth. You are, of course, free to allow your pack''s culture to evolve naturally -- there''s no need to set this information down right away -- but you should make an effort to accurately describe the pack''s tendencies on this page. Making it clear what the appeal is to your pack can help draw newcomers to thing to beware of in setting down a culture (or anything, really) for a new pack is to consider the feasibility of what you want in roleplay. Think about ''Souls procedures, obviously, but also think about how fun or restrictive you''re being. It''s okay if you want to be restrictive toward members, but do remember that an exceptionally restrictive culture can be seen as austere, and if you develop a reputation as a too-strict pack that expects too much of its members, your pack''s numbers may start to suffer! Remember flexibility -- a lax leader is as good as an extremely strict one in certain instances (both OOC and thing to beware of in writing down a culture for an existing pack is to accurately describe the pack. It can be tempting to fluff a description with added information and things you wish would happen, but consider when editing an existing culture page that you may wish to eliminate parts that are not strictly adhered to by members or leaders. If you can''t remember what the heck you want your members to do as far as culture, rituals, procedures, etc., and you want to be strict regarding the pack''s IC culture, it''s time to chop down and eliminate some information -- what you don''t remember is clearly unimportant, so get rid of Pages and You may wish to list your members -- past and present -- somewhere on the site. This certainly isn''t mandatory, and if you include any information about the character(s) in question, you may wish to leave this list to the forum, as it is likely to be frequently updated.

If your pack has buttons, banners, or other images for members to display their pack pride, you should absolutely list them on your website Your pack history isn''t that important to new members, but it may be fun for old members to browse.

These types of statuses cannot be reflected in Game Stats, Pack Summary Your pack should be listed in the Active Pack Summary.

The Leader Handbook', of a leader of a pack at ''Souls, you are expected to maintain a responsible and professional attitude. Be kind and courteous; do your best to keep your temper in check. It''s important to make sure that all of your pack members feel comfortable around you!

Leaders who would intentionally break the rules of ''Souls will be treated as harshly as the average member if not more so, as with any position of added responsibility on and Open are expected to remain as impartial as possible in all situations. Be aware that other leaders do play characters in your pack, and while there''s nothing wrong with entertaining a good relationship with other leaders, this can cause even the best of us to lose our impartiality, even for a moment. Leaders should respect one anothers'' forum topics and semi-privacy -- we can all see into each other''s pack topics in the leader can give the leader with multiple characters an unfair advantage and can harm impartiality to some degree even if the leaders are not good friends. For example, if you play a character in a pack other than the one you lead and you have low post counts for an activity check, avoid commentary on your reasons and avoid apologizing for it. While it may seem harmless, apologies or explanations for poor activity can sway impartiality and cause a leader to feel guilty; avoid putting that kind of pressure on others. Remember, too, that the average member of ''Souls cannot offer added explanation for their absence come post-counting in general, open dialogue in the leader forum is absolutely wonderful, and we encourage leaders to share ideas, codes, resources, and so forth -- posting in response to even these handbook topics with questions or suggestions is recommended and encouraged (edits can easily be made later; discussion can be split or deleted off as necessary). Many packs emulate one another anyway, and there''s nothing wrong with that -- if you see something someone else has done and you can adapt it for your pack (and perhaps even improve on it in the process), that''s are encouraged to have a variety of new and ongoing discussion topics, including, but not limited to, topics about ranks, plots, games and contests, and other pack-related features. To facilitate this, each pack may opt for an individual discussion forum within the Leader''s Forum.

Quite the Team', OOC OOC He had crouched but an instant after Veyra at the sound of the browsing deer, and though it was more difficult for him to move his bulk silently he did a fair job of it, avoiding spooking the doe. There was a tense moment, however, where the leaves stopped crunching and the tawny ears swiveled round, searching for any sound. Veyra was well camouflaged enough and quiet enough to keep moving slowly, but Callum went dead still to wait out the risk. Finally the doe had continued her meal and Cal rejoined Veyra turned to him and made a long moment of eye contact that the male returned. He was ready to go when she was; all she need do was say the word. Callum was more a freight train than a sprinter and would be slower moving and probably fall behind Veyra right at the beginning of their dash but his powerful legs and long stride would quickly bring him back to her side. He gave the barest hint of a nod, then tore his pumpkin eyes from the emeralds of his love and fixed them on the tawny backs and flicking white tails of the When Veyra broke cover, so did Callum. As he would have predicted, the princess bounded ahead of him a length, two, three, but then his stride lengthened and he made the distance up. Very seldom did he use this hunting method for this reason exactly: it was far easier, if hunting with a partner, to have the deer herded to him and to grab a limb or a neck as it passed by him, and if he were alone, he would be outstripped by the deer before he could get up to speed and with no one to run with the deer they could disappear into the brush and As Veyra had predicted, some of the deer fell back, a couple older ones that could no longer maintain the speed of their juniors. It was these that the pair victimized, selecting one from the bunch and focusing on it.

However, some soft guidelines are laid out below -- do feel free to adjust to your pack as you are uncertain whether your game or contest is structured properly, ask your fellow leaders and the ''SA for evaluation and input! Even if you''re sure your game is sound, discussion and sharing is good -- a great idea for one pack to participate in can easily turn into an idea where two packs are actively participating, making the experience better for members and those running the contest as prizes for pack games are outlined below. Leaders are not, of course, to these prizes. You may make any sort of prize for any contest you''d like, within reason. Obviously, it''s unreasonable to hold a contest where you''re offering administrator power for a month for winning a pack contest; it''s not unreasonable to offer icons, titles, may offer customizations for the individual character. tables, and are great ideas and relatively simple to make. Art avatars are fine, too -- if you can''t draw yourself and you have the spare money, try to find an at willing to take a contest-based commission. Art prizes can be extremely it is that leaders purchase prizes from the ''Souls store (e.g., custom icons and titles), this is in no way required. It is acceptable for leaders to offer temporary premade titles and icons for on-going events, as well as permanent custom titles and icons for big, one-time events. The icons can be provided by you (note that they may be edited to suit ''Souls or requested by a member of the ''Souls store purchases, we generally discourage prize or items -- titles and icons in particular have become ridiculously easy to earn, and they may begin to lose their charm and motivational factor, in addition to possibly losing revenue ''Souls might generate for bills by selling these through the which cannot be offered without explicit consent from the ''Souls Assemblage include Spreadshirt (currently inactive) or other merchandise for which there would be a direct cost to ''Souls. If you want to purchase these items yourself and offer them to members, that''s fine -- however, ''Souls won''t incur costs for these items, unlike free items and Restricted you keep a running list of when people''s timed prizes (e.g., custom title for three months, etc.) expire. The ''SA does not track these things and will not remember to remove the title; if the member just plain forgets or even if they''re dishonest they may not remember to tell you, you have a restricted prize -- e.g., a custom title in your pack colors -- remember that members can purchase exchange and change tokens through various means (e.g., the ''Souls Store and Word of the Day). We can''t restrict change tokens according to prize specifications (too difficult to track!) so please keep that in mind when giving out title Titles and titles and icons can be given away as part of a pack game or contest. Again, as per the information, we do these titles are bought and purchased but we don''t require it. If you wish to give away a outside of a you purchase custom title prizes title for -- or months are in color(s) or custom title, or in or solid colors or a Offering three different permanent titles with different levels of colorfulness, word length, or even number of different CSS effects is also acceptable (e.g., word title with CSS effects) and can help create different types of prizes of various costs or contest efforts. Complexity should incur more cost, custom icon prizes icon for It''s a lot more common for leaders to offer a standard custom icon as a contest prize rather than a custom icon for a set time period, unless you can make icons yourself and do them to ''Souls specifications. It can be a pain for administrators to have to whip up a new custom icon as per each member''s request for only a set time period, too, whereas a standard custom icon offered repeatedly to different members is far less custom You can request for these icons to be made by the admins, or you can ask for the other leaders to do it, or you can try to do it yourself. See the '', '', 
important to remember the of your game or contest in regards to the ways members can earn points versus the price of each prize. For example, if a character receives points for every word post they make and there are many, many other ways to earn points, your permanent custom icon price should be around - points. Alternatively, if you allow for word count points and there are no other methods of earning points in your game, you can make your custom icon price a little bit sure to organize and stipulate rules carefully. Some members will seek loopholes around the rules, sad as it is, but more importantly, should be clear in the first place to avoid confusion and later heartache! of pack game points to the character''s new pack, or the player''s new character''s pack, is allowed only if the leaders of both packs points transfer is the discretion of both leaders in question and can be granted or denied for any reason or no reason, we would like to gently discourage transfers for reasons other than a pack change, death, or other decommissioning of character. Again, game prizes are easy to earn, and forcing members to keep a stockpile of points in your pack can potentially make them return to your pack. We suggest that you establish your own pack policies regarding points transfer and reasons why it will or will not be approved for members to refer none of the game ideas here are leaders offer points for word posts, points for word posts, points for word posts, etc. You can arrange these points any way you''d like -- it might be easier for you to simply offer points per words posted. However, if you adopt such a system and no matter the system, try to encourage members to write a bit more for their posts in your game. words is the of ''Souls, though it isn''t enforced as a strict guideline, so earning points for a post of words is a great co-ranks, completing a useful task for the pack, or other In Character challenges etc. Try not to make the tasks so esoteric that they are impossible to complete and try to balance the points earned to the difficulty of the specially designed for your pack -- e.g., Salsola''s Anicombs or Inferni''s Legionnaire '', 'lapakfpm', '', 
good to draft material first -- post it in the leader''s forum and let other leaders give input on your contest. Remember, however, that leaders do play characters in multiple packs. Depending on the type of contest, you may want to take your plans (and especially your judgement) to PM or another private venue such as Google like games, again -- if members don''t have to exert much effort to complete the contest, consider your prizes and try not to be too extravagant with them. Structure is about your contest in the Pack News forum and tag the thread with at the beginning. If it''s a contest only for specific packs rather than all packs, you should say so right in the title or subtitle -- e.g., If your contest is directed toward one pack but outsiders are welcome to participate (but not necessarily receive prizes) you might want to tag your subtitle differently -- e.g., and others Check the for a basic idea of how you might style this Regarding Submission is kind of unspoken in that contest contributions to the site -- whether they''re simply ideas or actual drafts of information -- can be remixed and adapted as necessary with concerns to realism, grammatical correctness, and just in general -- perhaps, as a leader, you dislike part of someone''s idea but think another part is really great. Where specific contests are concerned with member submissions, it may be a good idea to include a forewarning about example, if Superawesome Pack runs a subterritory contest, and Azazel submits an idea for a territory that is really great but makes heavy mention of or reference to a plant or animal that is not native to or invasive in Nova Scotia, you have every right to use their idea and remove the parts that aren''t realistic while using the parts that somewhat discourage leaders from redoing someone''s idea where a contest or territory is concerned -- e.g., try to keep the original spirit of their idea or at least part of their original contribution intact -- but we absolutely understand that sometimes, ideas simply aren''t feasible, parts of them are incorrect or inaccurate, etc. Adaptation is your discretion, but it may help to avoid any hurt feelings by preemptively reminding members of this in the contest contests if you''re expanding or changing your pack territory in any contests if you''re changing your pack''s co-rank contests (write x amount of words in x amount of searches (you can ask the ''SA to hide icons for you -- but make you keep a list of where they are so we can remove them when you''re the forum contests -- write a certain number of threads in a certain territory or subterritory within a given amount of promotion contests -- create art, plots, and other baubles to entice players to pick up a pack''s adoptable as necessary, of description and summary of the contest Will This MM Description of what must be done by MM Description of what must be done by MM Description of what must be done by your anticipate members having questions regarding the write your answers your anticipate members having questions regarding the write your answers your anticipate members having questions regarding the write your answers Lorem Lorem Lorem Lorem Consolation Lorem '',

Community Spotlight Souls', of month, the leaders collectively decide to nominate one or two different members to highlight them for their activity or contributions to the site. There are two distinctively different spotlights -- the traditional and long-standing Spotlight Soul, which highlights a players'' In Character plots and distinctions, and the Community Soul, which highlights a players'' general activity and Out of Character contributions to the month, as close to the beginning of the fourth week of that month as possible, a topic should be started to look for nominations for both of these are free to nominate any member -- it does not have to be a member of their pack. In fact, if no one from their pack has shown themselves to be stellar in the last month, nominations from other packs are debate, and back and forth are highly encouraged. You change your vote once it''s official, but to decrease confusion, consider simply suggesting someone at first, and coming back later to confirm your vote -- if you post later in agreement with someone else (even if you do not wish to change your vote) it may cause confusion come time. If you want to be helpful, you can post a summary of who has proposed what so far in the discussion thread for members to confirm their enumerate your reasons for why you are selecting a Spotlight or Community Soul. It is helpful for two reasons: one, the administrator who writes the description of the topic may quote you directly (anonymously, of course); two: your good reasoning may sway someone else''s basis for Spotlight Soul is activity. The nomination for Spotlight Soul should be geared toward a not a player. Out of character activity should not be taken into consideration. Look for active members who with the character you are selecting for the nomination. They should be active with all of their current characters -- e.g., the person needn''t be as active with all their characters as they are with the character you wish to nominate, but try to avoid nominating players who are noticably inactive with the characters other than your in interesting plots. Participation includes effort in engaging with the membership with their characters. The nominee is perhaps a familiar face in the Thread Requests forum, or posts and replies to many Open in pack threads or pack activities, if applicable. Loners and Creatures can and should be considered as Spotlight Souls, but if the nominee is in a pack, they are perhaps aiming for a Co-Rank, often seen within their pack forum (though beware of nominating members who seem to ignore everyone but their packmates!) or otherwise engaged with their basis for Community Soul is of activity. While the criteria are examples and suggestions, please be aware that there a vast number of ways a member can prove him or herself deserving of this nomination. So long as there is substantial reason why the person receives a nomination, that is what matters. While there is ideally a Spotlight Soul every month, this Community Soul spotlight can be given slightly less frequently, ie, it''s okay to go a few months without a Community for active members who active and contributing to threads in the OOC areas -- even OOC chatter can be helpful; look out especially for critique or compliments in Talents, (correctly) answering responses in the Help and Questions forum, or even just respectful responses and in the Player Updates of drama, attitude problems, etc. Always respectful, polite, etc. This member would never intentionally break the with all characters, though perhaps not to the engaging and degree of the Spotlight Soul (Note that while the basis of the Community Soul is OOC activity, if the member has a character should be reasonably active with him or her. However, a member can still be chosen for this spot even without an active actively to their pack and assisting their leader (e.g., helping with contests or producing pack pride images, etc). In contrast to Spotlight Soul, this also places hefty focus on OOC activity -- while they shouldn''t be the member in question also focuses on the Out of Character aspects of the pack as and becoming involved in unique plots and storylines.

She was five years old and had yet to become a mother of her own pups. Back with her birth mother, she had been forced to be practically celibate and having pups was a close to a death sentence. Now that she was alphess, it was past time for her to have a litter. To make matters worse, every other female in the pack had been blessed with a litter and Zalen had several puppies of his own running around that didn''t belong to Raeka. She tried her best to love them and treat her as her own, but in her heart she could still feel the separation and ended up treating them other pack members instead. She didn''t want to reject them and did her best to hide this fact, but it was still difficult for her to see them as her top of the litter Zalen had with one of the subordinate females, there was another pup of his that had recently joined the pack. Veyra was X''yrin''s pup and that just irked Raeka to no end. Her opinion of the Shepherd was not very high, and that was putting it mildly. She and the leader of Sangi''lak did not see eye to eye and after their last encounter Raeka''s opinion of X''ryin did not improve.

about Glass Blowing', 'Hey everyone, I got this PM last night from a new member, inquiring about two characters having knowledge of glass blowing. Tue Jul Brisco Anu there! Figured I should message a mod about this. My friend (currently registered as Nadir Lan) and I were truly hoping to make a pair of new characters not too far down the road once we get more familiar with this place. We were hoping we might be able to make a pair of glassblowers -- an old man and his pup apprentice. However, we weren''t sure such a talent would be allowed. Glass-making was created in the middle of the last century BC, so it''s been around for quite some time and I figure it wouldn''t have taken too long for some luperci to be able to re-figure it out, especially if they found any of the tools left behind by humans. Not to mention the materials to make glass are quite abundant. Would such a character be allowed here? We''re trying not to get our hopes up much but we figured it would be a fairly interesting, unique idea to use. Of course their skills would be limited only to things such as viles and bottles, so we wouldn''t be adding too much to what the luperci have access to. Let me know what you think, is what I sent her this morning, Lauren! idea of glass-blowing is definitely a fun one! Since I''m not familiar with any precedent in regards to Glass-blowing I am going to bring up you question to the other mods and admins so that I can get your the best possible answer!

It was the skin she preferred anyways- the one she was born and grown in, and the one she felt truly herself bow had become unsatisfactory- whenever she shot she was a hair off of where she wanted, and it’s because the crafting was amateur. The white birch was a faint yellow with age- she’d created the weapon almost a year ago, give or take a couple months. She hadn’t known the proper way to finish it, by sealing it off so that the wear wasn’t as great. Now that she knew many a more than she had before, it was due for a reconstruction. Her quiver would do, and her arrows were fine, though she’d have to create some more as she’d lost several throughout various activities. She’d left early that morning, and now the sun was sinking. She’d sleep nearby somewhere for the night, and when the sun rose she’d get to work. But for now, she needed to find a place to slumber without renewing fears. Ever since she was young and had acquired the long scar on her face, she was wary about where she slept, and triple checked to make sure it was safe. She couldn’t handle more memories like gray nostrils flared, and the wolfess halted, flipping her head to the left. She was familiar with the scent. She’d once talked with one of the pack’s leaders… what was his name… Mido? Yes, he’d invited her to perhaps approach his packlands before. The thought of asking for shelter of the night shadowed the girls’ mind, but she pushed it away. She wouldn’t want to seem a burden. She was capable of finding a place to sleep. But that didn’t mean she couldn’t take a quick detour to just look her eyes beyond the walked for no more than a minute when another smell alerted her senses- somebody was here. Lyris stopped, eyeing a small, neutral shape of a canine along the border. Lyris paused, and without too much thought, she stepped from the shadows of trees, green eyes flashing curiously.

It was apparent that her time was drawing near, but the youngest Revlis child was growing weary with anticipation. She was no longer enthralled by the innocence of youth, and longed instead for the complexity of adulthood. Green eyes had fallen upon their Queen and looked to her now with such reverence and inspiration; she saw in Salvia reminders of her father and all that she wanted to be. Lily wanted nothing more than to be able to prove restricted to four legs she still was, and so Clover had been gracious enough to aid her daughter in accomplishing the tasks she had set out for herself. The most pressing issue now was the gifts – Lily had come up with ideas, but executing their presentation would not come easily without the use of Luperci hands. Clover had tied the smalls bags of potpourris, teas, cannabis, and jewelry so that Lily could deliver them on her own. She had been persistent about giving them out by herself, as it was one thing she do on her own. There was only one person who had intercepted her on her gift delivery, but Lily didn’t mind that the recipient knew the gift giver’s identity. All in all, the girl had deemed the early morning adventure a time for the feast arrived, and Lily rose from her place in the Ruins and looked expectantly to her mother. Clover smiled approvingly, truly at peace to see her daughter so excited about her first big Salsolan celebration, and rose to follow her off to the hall. Lily led the way, chatting excitably about the gifts she had given and what she predicted the night would words died away as the warm glow of the lanterns played shadows against the wall and set a warm, inviting feel to the place. She was in awe for a moment, simply taking in her surroundings before she let her green gaze travel to those who had already was a woman she had seen before, but had never spoken to. As Lily and her mother advanced into the hall, the woman’s back was turned to them as she spoke to another Salsolan. It took Lily a second to figure out who was on the other side of her Famly member and her green eyes widened in shock when she knight was there, be no longer was trapped in the body of youth. He was an adolescent now, gifted with the form Lily had yet to receive. The silver knight looked happy to bet there, just as Lily was, beaming with a smile. It reminded her of the same sort of look he had presented at chasing the chickens – handsome, confident, and with a subtle hint of mischief. Lily watched with somewhat jealous eyes as the two of them spoke and seemed to exchange her gaze easily broke away from the duo when she found the magnificent presence of the Boss. Donned in the skin of a grizzly, Lily was reminded of her father, of whom she did not know truthfully well but adored all the same. Her heart panged for the man she and her mother had left She called cheerfully to them all, before throwing her gaze over her shoulder at her mother. In one hand Momma Clover held a tiny bag of cloth, and from it she produced the other hand clenched in a fist.

Her eyes were glazed over and Kiara wasn''t even sure if her daughter could hear her anymore. Even so, Kiara continued to coo and console, offering whatever words she could to ease the transformation. Yet, it didn''t seem to end. The whole process dragged on for what seemed like an eternity and Lucia''s distress simply continued to grow.

Chat Moderation', of Moderators are encouraged to hang out in the chat to moderate user interaction and make sure everything stays Try not to moderate heavy-handedly: e.g., users cursing once or twice in the course of several minutes (even f-bombs) isn''t a big reason to poke the chat. If users are cursing twice in a single sentence or back to back, though, you might want to poke them the next time they curse and just ask them to tone it down a notch. Remember that isn''t either. Though actual arguments are much rarer than rule-breaking, they''re still a very serious matter and should be treated as such. Moderators typically have far more leeway in their judgement and jurisdiction in the chatroom than on the board. Simply because of the live-action nature of the chat, situations can spiral out of control very quickly and there''s not always time to grab an administrator. In general, if your gut instinct tells you something needs to happen, we encourage you to Members should be mindful of all board rules and refrain from spamming the chat with nonsense and garbage. A little fun is okay, but if people are complaining, publicly ask the entire chat to remain more on topic. Following that, warn individual users who continue to misbehave.

He wasn''t answering, he wasn''t and Shiloh ceased her motions for an instant, ears strained and full of her own rapid breathing and little else. She tossed the stick she grasped aside, staring at the snow and thinking. Slowly, she arrived at the same conclusions that the young male the branches that brought down all this snow might serve to support it. If she had some way of knowing the condition of the entrance, she could know for sure whether it was blocking it or if it might serve as a boon to the two digging out the ears flattened at Taro''s suggestion, but she did not immediately disagree. It was dangerous, but what else was the job of an Araedi? If nothing else, whoever managed to crawl in would be able to tell whether the entrance was fully blocked or not. With enough of the sticks out of the way, a small place could be cleared, the branches perhaps lifted to bear the go Shiloh decided. I could not bear to look at your mother if you were caught she added in silence. Both of them had much to live for, one with family and one with so much potential, but Shi wouldn''t dream of sending Taro under the snow. we get to the branches... you bear that. I''ll crawl she crouched in the snow, undoing the sinew ties of the cloak at her throat, grasping her wooden cat pendant an instant. She tossed the thing aside and fell upon hands and knees, waiting for Taro to get in position. When they were ready, Shiloh sent one last prayer to the gods and dug away at some more of the snow, pushing herself space under the entangled tree limbs, and she was barely small enough to get in. She moved quickly, breath frosting before her, the world dark and light at the same time. Her fingers touched earth, and her ears strained for the sound of breathing, a soft echo of a grunt in the earthen hollow as she reached out and grabbed a fistful of fur. Breathing softly, moving carefully, she grabbed him and quickly whispered hushed, comforting words when the barely-conscious male whined in just another Shiloh shouted down the tunnel. Snow fell before her, but she tugged the Lupus-formed male and then, at last, was sprawled in the sunlight with the wolf in her lap, her breaths coming quick with fear she could betray now that the worst was over. auto; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, .ooc solid; .ooc p p b:before b:after b.npc .img float:right; font-style:italic; text-align:center; img '', '',

simple summer ventures', 'Aspen’s jaw was clenched and her body rigid as Iris told her to relax. She knew the other female was right; relaxing was necessary. She was probably more likely to fall if she was this stiff than if she was relaxed, even just a little bit. Iris got onto Signe’s back, Aspen took several deep breaths and tried to relax her legs like Iris told her to do. Luckily Alazne did not seem fazed by having such a nervous rider on her back; her head hung a bit low with her relaxation as she waited patiently for Aspen to ask her to move. Then, all too quickly, it was time to go. Aspen’s head snapped up as Iris nudged Signe forward and her eyes widened. She couldn’t quite make her limbs comply with what she needed to do right away she nodded and moved her hands forward a bit. Alazne’s head lifted and Aspen tensed again before she managed to just barely nudge the horse’s sides with her legs. Alazne reacted right away, and Aspen felt hyper aware of each shift in the horse’s weight: forward and to the side a little as she built a little momentum to start moving. Each step made Aspen feel off balance and the ground seemed so far away. couple deep breaths and Aspen tried to let her hips follow the movements hoping that it would make her feel a bit less like she was going to fall. She couldn’t imagine going any faster at this point, although she had seen others riding at a gallop. It was mind boggling that they even managed to stay on. this isn’t so Aspen said, looking up towards Iris, who seemed to really be enjoying herself. This slow pace, at least, she thought she might eventually be able to get used to. Either way, if it made Alazne happy to go get some exercise like this, Aspen would try to keep doing it. um, do you stay on w-while going faster?

He''d enough regret in his life as it was, and so he focused instead in seeking out the lost of his search would be contained to the Kingdom''s land claim, as he doubted the herd animals would flee far from the familiarity of their normal pastures, but the Haskel male wanted to briefly patrol the fringe of neutral forest that butted against his territory. A horse would be more easily lost or injured in the thick, foggy woods. He kept to his smallest, most natural form and moved with an enduring pace, nose to the ground and tail high over his back as he wandered game trails and crossed one point, Skoll caught the odor of horse. He stopped, sniffing the clump of ferns, some stems stripped of leaves where the animal might have browsed. Rigid, he sniffed a few moments longer before deciding that the horse was not of Cour des Miracles, without the scent of their lands or Alder strongly tied in with the odor. It might have belonged to a passing loner or another pack.

Odin was not only removing his presence, but also their mare, Primrose. He claimed they wouldn’t be gone long, but that she should find something to entertain herself.

Perhaps settling into a pack was good for him, although opposite his sister’s particular requirements. first, the girl merely wallowed in the severity of her isolation. On the days he was gone Snapdragon was constantly nervous, giving up on meeting others. When he finally heard of her demise, Odin tried to encourage his sister to visit the barn in the territory. He couldn’t shake the idea he was responsible for Snapdragon. she took his advice, Snapdragon found herself content spending time with the horses. Many were out during the day with their riders but some of the foals were in and their long legs easily entertained her. But what Snapdragon ultimately found to fill her time, was the greenhouse.

No, Elissa hadn’t known about Sidra when she’d slept with Aro and in her mind, it was testament that she wasn’t interested in him that she hadn’t slept with him when she arrived in Casa. Still, she allowed the woman to say her piece, her ears pushed forward to catch every scathing syllable. Her arms uncrossed, moving to sit on her hips again as an eyebrow remained raised, especially when Sidra moved a little closer. caused Elissa’s hackles to raise a little, but she made no move otherwise to show that it bothered her. All the crimson woman saw were insecurities which Sidra soon admitted. She was a little surprised to hear that Aro had a son, but she wasn’t somehow bothered by it. The woman had seen how gentle he was with Buck and knew he’d be a good father. A good mate? Likely not. But most definitely a kind, loving and guiding father. She wasn’t bothered even when Sidra repeated that Aro was hers and so harshly suggested she stay away from him. It sounded more like a threat to her, and Elissa wasn’t fond of receiving threats, so her own eyes narrowed Sidra, let me just begin by saying you’ve no idea what kind of person I she began, her voice laced with an underlying threat. Even if she wasn’t a stellar wolf, she wasn’t going to allow herself to be insulted and let it go unchecked. If Sidra continued to treat her this way, she would soon find out why so few dared to reprimand her. show respect for others when I find they deserve it, and so far, all I see you doing is having a tantrum. I have no interest in Aro. It’s very much a ‘been there, done that’ scenario and you needn’t she said curtly. It was true.

Please see the for specific restrictions regarding your picture should be in .GIF, .PNG, or .JPG format. GIF files can only handle colors and thus your files might look different than when they did in the photo program; they are also abnormally large, and thus JPG is preferable. PNG format has the advantage of being lossless; however, these files can be large when used for larger images and should be avoided. If all of this talk of filetypes confuses you, best bet is you have a finished avatar, you will need to upload it. You can upload it to the forum itself -- this is generally the simpler and recommended a free host such as or your the URL for your picture: m m for instance.

To ensure that your signature looks right for everyone, use a .PNG or .GIF image signature with a transparent background. It''s important to remember to keep your signature readable across as many skins as Signature roleplayers also place image or table credits, absence notices, or open character advertisements in their signatures in addition to, or in place of, the traditional signature. Some people choose to promote various aspects of ''Souls in their signature -- for example, displaying some pack pride, or even encouraging others to edit the Wiki or vote for ''Souls every day. Logs and These three similar things are meant to track your character''s threads and your character''s graphics. You can keep them in -- you guessed it -- the and Graphic forum. You may find it easier to keep these things on the Wiki or even in your forum profile (though beware the character post log is just that -- a log of all the roleplay threads your character is currently active in. Things typically included in a post log are reply status, a thread link, the thread title, and the participants. Reminders can also be kept in a post users also keep an archive of their character''s finished topics separate from their post log, but in a similar users also keep a log of their character''s graphics somewhere to facilitate their easy use. You should never store things in the Talents forum -- threads are periodically ''Souls, many roleplayers enjoy using graphical or post templates to write their posts. A table can be constructed out of basic HTML tables or CSS-styled div elements. For some excellent basic guides, see Post on Forum basic table generally includes an image and In Character and Out of Character labels. Beyond that, there''s really no limit to what can constitute a table. If you aren''t really sure where to start, you can always ask around in the Talents forum, look at a few tutorials, or just ask someone else to make one for you. Text can format the text almost any way you''d like -- but make sure your text is common safe are Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, and Trebuchet MS. You can also use Web and similar embedding services -- but be careful and keep readability in font sizes are generally - Your precise font size may vary depending on your Common Table Mistakes is, at its heart, a writing community. These five common mistakes make it very difficult to read other roleplayer''s writing and make it more difficult to roleplay. This can range from a mild annoyance to a serious hindrance to roleplaying. Do want to reply to threads when you have to squint and struggle to read the other person''s writing? Little first common mistake: failure to include enough contrast between the table background and the table text. For users with darker monitors, contrast between darker colours is difficult to distinguish. Another important consideration is color contrast -- if your contrast for text and background is poor, users will have difficulty reading your you cannot read this very well! you can read this text very well! you cannot read this very well! you can read this text very well! or Improper a small, or generally unreadable font. Small text can be difficult to read for users with big screen resolutions. Poor font choices are also equally problematic: if you choose to use a front like or not only will it make your table difficult to read but also make your post look rather silly! Here are some you cannot read this very Hi, you can read this text very you cannot read this very well! Hi, you can read this text very are various ways to style your text, and while they do give you quite a lot of control, some stylistic choices make reading very difficult. Certain types of text style should be left for headers and subheaders, rarely used in speech, and avoided entirely in the main body should never be used for table text, not for speech or thought, and definitely not for your primary choice. Text-transform should never be used for table text, whether that is to change everything to uppercase, lowercase, or initial-caps. None are appropriate. Letter-spacing can be used in moderation, but too much and your text becomes unreadable, fast! Line height is another important consideration -- too much or too little, and your text becomes far less you cannot read this very well! Imagine if there was a lot of text, like this!

While it can spice up the dialogue when you bold your text, it can also make it very difficult to read if everything has a significant or stark you cannot read this very text-shadow:#cfcfcf you can read this text very CSS opacity is particularly problematic because not only does it make the background transparent, it also makes the transparent.

If you absolutely must use a scroll table, please ensure the height and width give other players enough room to read and comply if they ask you to change important consideration is that some mobile browsers do not properly support the CSS command. Mobile users can''t scroll your post at all. In these cases, you''re actually forcing users to quote your post to read it, which is unfair! readability problem exists with justified text alignment.

Zalen was right behind them in the brush, doubtlessly watching with those apple green eyes of his as her mate came upon her. He wasn’t even tired, his strong hunter’s body handling the challenge of chasing her down easily. Of course, Ciara could have kept going as well, could have run for hours longer if she’d wanted to, but she wanted him to catch her.

Muscle adorned his frame and he looked so large and strong that Ciara knew he might crush her if she weren’t in the same form.

Her tongue escaped her jaws, licking at her lips as doe-brown eyes narrowed on him. He spoke to her, taunting, but Ciara couldn’t form words.

Suddenly a whimper left her, her body squirming as he sniffed at her, growling so close to her sex that she swore she could feel it she said breathlessly. The look in those predatory eyes of his almost had her feinting on the spot, staring back at him with heat burning in her own eyes. She turned then, presenting him with his prize and flicking her tail to the side. Instantly Augustus would see the silken folds of her core, the glistening moisture on them. The chase had aroused her and she was ready to be taken, her heat and the sheer masculinity of her mate calling to primal needs she hadn’t felt since her last heat.

we''ll lose our feathers', this turned into a legit novel. sorry not sorry | Word Count did not want to be here. Somehow, he knew with one-hundred percent certainty, that something bad would happen and it would be all his fault and then Panda would yell at him and the puppies would get scared and then they wouldn''t like him, either, and they wouldn''t be allowed anywhere near him. Or, rather, he wouldn''t be allowed anywhere near So he''d likely get kicked out of the caves or something. Not that it mattered. He''d at least get away from the rest of the small pack then. He shifted uncomfortably atop Catori and Yuri was trying his best to keep the boy calm; he could sense that, if given the chance, Maxen would likely hop off his horse and run off. So one arm was wrapped protectively around the boy while the other gripped the reigns. All he could do was try to comfort the princess with his presence and touch, try to keep him calm. Something beyond his senses was happening and the three royalties could see it. He turned his eyes to the side to look at them without moving his head to see. He snapped his head over, though, when the young boy said something about momma''s He seemed extremely startled and had the look of someone who was expecting to be punished right after that. It didn''t make sense to him but he knew it was bad that he was upsetting one of the babies. Ears shot back and he sank into Yuri, leaning to the side as if to get away from the Malpas and her children. He didn''t mean his breathing quickened and became uneven, he inwardly began to panic. The last thing he wanted to do was piss Panda off again. She had ripped into him before given no reason, when he hadn''t even done anything to deserve it. Now she was going to scream at him because he upset Viper. His breathing became shaky and he looked down at the saddle under him. He even wanted to cry, but he sure as hell wouldn''t let that happen. Not now, not in front of She told the boy that she hadn''t been hurt and he flinched at every word that came out of her mouth. When she snorted, he jumped. And when she began to speak and the tone of her words made obvious that he''d said the wrong thing already, his eyes narrowed painfully, like a youngster being yelled at and disciplined by their parent. He said nothing else and merely listened to the older woman. Once again his gaze snapped over to her at her words. Nephews? More? More family to hate his guts. His stomach flopped and he shifted again, looking to the side of the woman but not moving his head away from her. It didn''t make him happy to hear his sister had more babies. He didn''t get to bond with her, and she had puppies that were so much better than her own brother. And they were spoiled. Spoiled because their mother was the alpha, and her mate was also a leader. They had... three mothers and a father. And what did he have? ... Nothing. He never had. It was probably stupid and yes, he did hate himself for it, but he was jealous. Honestly. And he felt more isolated than before. Aeron''s family was growing. People loved her. She had three mates, children... a pack. Maxen bit his lip and forced himself to stop thinking about it because it would probably upset that puppy again or something. The young thing could sense something... or maybe it was just too obvious how uncomfortable and scared he was. It didn''t could feel how much more the news was upsetting the Ganesa boy, despite him doing a decent job of not freaking out about it. Leaning to his other side, the side away from Panda, he leaned forward and bumped his nose against Maxen''s neck then nuzzled his cheek when he turned at the touch. He seemed to settle a little bit, gold eyes turning back to Panda in a much calmer manner. He did jump at the boy''s voice, looking skittishly down at him. He kept glancing back up at Panda fearfully, like he wasn''t even allowed to look at her babies. He felt like it, anyways. That cute little smile-- it was then that he noticed his upper fangs were clearly poking out of his mouth. Glancing to the brother he noticed the same thing with him. And then he noticed that they were twins-- no, not twins. The other boy had marks under his eyes when his brother didn''t. Damn close to twins though. Bri-cri-oo. Bricriu? Where did that nickname come from? He didn''t have time to think about it because he was asked to play. And he became just as scared as he had been when little Valérian had approached him and asked him to play. He''d had a very scary rottweiler guardian though even he wasn''t as scary as Panda. He shook his head lightly, questioningly, looking confused. No, he couldn''t. He wasn''t allowed. He was gross and stupid-- they wouldn''t want to be around him if he got off Catori. He blinked hard and bit his lip again, looking to Panda submissively and showing that fear again. They had asked to play but he was terrified she was going to yell at him for even considering it. Those cute faces. Not even Maxen could say no to those. But his fear of Panda overrided the powerful puppydog eyes. hadn''t even been sure why she was forcing and introduction to his newest nephews. Why? To... to tell him that once again he was just a worthless mongrel peasant, that even though he was a Ganesa that he was no one. That even though he was blood that he was not royalty and never had been. He had never been a part of that family. Was she making sure he knew that? Remembered? To make sure he would show full submission to the babies because they were Aeron''s? He felt like he was going to throw up; the anxiety was too much. He couldn''t answer them. The coydog was too scared. And he was too scared to say a word because he knew Panda would snap at him. Her tone would rip him to shreds, her gaze would burn him. Catori sidled a bit, away from the three luperci of royalty. Yuri steadied the beast that was growing antsy with the creatures upsetting him so badly. He wanted to say he wasn''t allowed. He wasn''t allowed to interact with such pristine creatures. To sully them with his presence, to be close to them. He was not allowed to even look at them, to breathe in their direction, to even think a single thought about them. Yuri held the shaking boy steady. should play with your the Russian said, his gruff, thickly accented voice bring just a bit of peace to the shattered Ganesa. it is But it wasn''t, it wasn''t. He shook his head, turning away from Panda to look at his companion. But he held firm, giving Maxen another surprisingly thing-- a face with an actual expression on it. He smiled at the coydog, comforting, encouraging. Then, his stressed, anxious, scared face turned back to wouldn''t move unless she gave him a clear yes. And even then, if her tone was anything but friendly and welcoming, he''d be too scared to move, and he wouldn''t. Maxen wouldn''t risk doing something wrong. So he looked to her questioningly but still worried. Worried even considering it was wrong and she''d get mad. He didn''t want her to get mad. He did actually want to play a little. Just a little, so they didn''t think he was some mean monster.

Welcome to the new board!', so much to all our members for being so understanding with us regarding the sudden move. We really appreciate it and ask for your continued patience and cooperation with us in the coming weeks as we adjust to the new forum platform and make further tweaks and adjustments to settle into our new home. Trust us when we say we know that change is hard, and it will take time to get used to the new board, but once again, this move was a long time coming, and we hope things will get easier moving forward. archived forum is by the registering your new account(s), returning members that were and at the time of the move should post in Migration with the requested information. Once we process your account, you should be good to go and may pick up posting and plotting right where you left Temporarily Suspended Until the next couple of days, Joining will be closed to new that were not active and titled at the time of the move, as well as Requests for character-based permissions from existing members. With a few administrators on absence for the weekend, the rest relatively scarce, and characters to get retitled and situated -- we''re a little short-handed.

We may look into bringing this back in the future, but admittedly, it is not a high priority at the to our old IPB platform, which is nearly a decade old, phpBB is newer and shinier and a lot more secure. However, this does not necessarily mean that it has more features, especially since many of the features you were used to on IPB were blatant hacks, accumulated through our long years using the software. Enabling HTML just about everywhere on the old board is the biggest example of that. It gave you guys a lot of freedom to customize and do what you wanted -- but it also a huge security risk we systematically ignored. Now that the security hole is closed again, it''ll take a significant effort to reopen it, and we''re not really sure that''d be worth going to give us the opportunity to try out a lot of other features we''ve never been able to consider. In the coming months, we definitely hope to be able to implement some of the nifty new tools available to us, but in the meantime, we''ve still got a lot of learning to do, a lot of broken links to fix, and so on. We hope you understand where we''re coming from, and after all, all the fancy things we had on IPB didn''t come all at once either. and Bugs (Pardon Our we can''t catch everything without your help! If you see anything weird around the board, etc, please post in the thread! We''re still fixing stuff up and some things are going faster than others, so apologies ahead of time if some issues take a while to address. We''re working on again for everyone''s support during this very rough week. Hopefully things will settle down '', '',

After all, he had abandoned the clan once before and there way no way he could make it known that he would not do so again. so he did not approach the borders. Instead he just looked longingly at its lands, letting the cigarette smoke fill his lungs and filter out the brief cold of the passing winds. He knew exactly why he had come back to Nova Scotia, but he couldn’t help feeling like so far it wasn''t turning out to be as he imagined. The Russo man felt as if he didn’t know where he belonged anymore. Surely he wasn’t meant for the sea, for during his stretch there he longed for the land.

Learn You Inside Out', there the innocent blood you have absorbed with the task at hand, she was quick to dismiss the sounds of soft footfalls within the library, assuming that no one would approach her or show interest in what she was working upon. More often than not she found herself at odds with the bulk of the pack, lacking in common grounds to be able to relate to and begin forming friendships with them. Back home everyone had the same or at the very least similar principles, the same interests and ran within the same circles, making everything all the easier on her. Out here in Sapient there was nothing similar, a pack that consisted of unique odd balls. assumption was wrong. Standing up from where she’d braced her hands upon the table to glare at the papers, fingers lifted to tangle in her curls, shoving the mess back as she turned to face Ardoise.

No matter how accidental the encounter was, it breathed a fire into each of their throats. His mate was livid, and Rio was disgusted with herself. However, now, being this close with Aro once more with new thoughts, ideas, and visions in her head, she no longer cared about what troubled her past with him.

my smiling skull at you', rabbits were laid out neatly before her, waiting to be skinned. Xylia sighed and raked her fingers gently though her long auburn hair, looking at the dead creatures and trying to decide how to prepare them. Ordinarily the lonely wolfess ate her meals raw, which suited her fine, but a creative whim had overtaken her, along with a longing curiosity for the taste of a different flavor. Chartruese eyes glanced toward her humble fire crackling in its pit, flames of orange and gold filling her tiny forest camp with soft gray smoke and a pleasant aroma. She bit her lower lip thoughtfully. She had cooked before, and enjoyed it. Her mother would not have approved of what she would deem wasted effort, and Xylia reminded herself that cooking her meat unnecessary. But she should very much like to try again. It wasn''t as if she had anything else to to herself, the agouti female took her knife and split the first rabbit up its middle, careful to spare the organs the pierce of the blade. Next she gutted the rabbit, discarding the inedible organs into the forest with a toss and placing the rest neatly on top of the dry log that she usually used as a chair. This process was repeated with the second rabbit, and she then removed the heads and skin from the muscular flesh of her kill, and laid the two corpses beside one another in the cast iron pan she had recently found on one of her scavenging trips to Saint John. Satisfied with her work so far, Xylia replaced the lid upon the pan. She grabbed a thick piece of cloth out of her satchel and wrapped it around the handle of the pan. Unfortunately, she did not have a cooking spit, so she would have to roast her supper by hand... She did not recall how long this would take, but hopefully the end result would be worth the muscle aches gained from suspending the heavy object above the fire -- without burning herself, twice-injured left arm would be used only if it took longer than a few moments to get the fatty juices flowing within the pan. The injury was completely healed, but still it ached dully in the chilly January weather. Sitting cross-legged before the fire, Xylia firmly grasped the wrapped handle of her pan and held it over the fire. Already she could see that this would not be a pleasant process. Growling softly to herself, she persisted, taking in a second deep sigh, and watching the fire until a soft sizzling sound from within the pan eased her nerves and encouraged her to keep holding on, so to auto; font-family:Georgia; text-align:justify; p:first-child:first-letter left; color: font-size: line-height: padding-top: padding-right: padding-left: p + p font-family:Georgia; p.oocstuff solid black; '', '',

Any one canine she came to cross paths with could be one of their members and attacking one of them for any reason whatsoever would have been to put her position in the presence of danger. The sound of an approaching voice littered the air behind her, a brief excursion that drew her stormy gaze behind her to the Viking behind was obvious that''s what the woman was.

In our days we will live like our ghosts will live', again~ but a novel to make up for it. P: once the desert dragon was not out prowling the borders, bow in hand, ready to strike down any stranger that dared even glance the wrong way. She had been patrolling so much, so often, and so tirelessly that in the end she didn''t have a choice but to stop at least once for some food and rest before she was no longer effective enough to do what she needed to do. With everyone else focusing on eliminating the enemy she was not about to let the coyote''s claim go challenged, by the Courtiers or anyone else looking for easy part in the war may have been small but it was still important in her eyes, which snapped open the moment the sound of the Centurion''s yowly howl rose into the air, summoning her from the depths of her fitful slumber and out to the meeting grounds where she awaited the clan. As usual the desert dragon was not the first nor the last to arrive, trickling in among the masses and taking her place near the back where she could easily hear but far enough away that she didn’t feel closed in by the rest of the pack. Rubbing the sleep from one molten gold eye she blinked a few times and surveyed the crowd before all attention shifted to focus upon their the war had come to an end, a peaceful one it seemed, and while the hatred she had for the Courtiers had long since drained away she still did not trust them. Now more than ever she was feeling like the only individuals she could trust were the coyotes gathered around her at that moment, and everyone else, everyone outside of the pack, were to be met with wariness before friendliness. This was a habit she was just beginning to lose, she was slowly coming out of her closed off shell and opening up to those around her, and while she felt the war had brought her closer to her pack, consequently it had hardened her to Marlowe as a traitor did not faze her, nor did the mention of Myrika stepping down, or Cartier rising up – they were coyotes she knew only a little, and only in passing, briefly seeing them around the pack, only shortly interacting with them, and nothing more. When Vesper mentioned she would be taking the lead as Inferni''s Aquila though, she smiled a contented smile, her sharp coyjack maw dipping affirmatively. What she knew of Vesper and their brief interactions had painted a positive picture, and so far she couldn''t find a reason not to like the changes, only a sudden swell of curiosity, wondering about what would come the new Aquila took her leave she did as well, turning away from the group and wandering off back to the mansion, to her room, to her bed.

Stark heard them but only lifted his head higher in spite of his mangled wing and twisted, heavy posture fell to feral, angry prowling as they traveled deeper into the woods, but Stark preened her messy mane in comfort. Some things were beyond Vesper to change, but she nonetheless wanted very badly to hurt someone. She was no healer, but she could kill things.

Sure she had just up until she''d allowed the wretched male to pull her shoulder from its socket. Her arm throbbed in remembrance of the event, even though it had long since fully healed. No comments or acknowledgements passed her lips at the Knight''s praise, believing it wasn''t quite well deserved. Lyris was so terribly critical, of herself as well as Corpo, however, continued with valid concerns that the Cavallo agreed with. The huntress leaned forward with her elbows on the stall gate, examining the rows of stalls just as Lorenzo had. She nodded, figuring she should show some outward gesture of acknowledgement. The scarred man talked with authority, voice absent of any pause or hesitation. Lorenzo came right out with what he wanted and lay down his reasons, leaping right to the admittance he aspired to become the War Lord. Lyris could not say she was surprised- for certainly this towering, defined Knight had enough physical skill as well as mental to hold such a position. The female had once considered the position of War Lord herself, but in retrospect had decided different paths were more accurate to her character. She loved to fight and the thrill it gave her was nearly addicting, but Lyris didn''t believe she would be a good leader in a battle. She was much too impulsive and aggressive. certainly She agreed, straightening to her full height from where she leaned against the gate. In the light of the Corpo''s suggestions and request, Lyris was silent for several moments before glancing back to Kenyon, briefly. He would make an excellent war horse, and he most certainly had the perfect spirit for it. Being her companion had already deemed the stallion more confident and skilled than any of the communal horses and several of the owned, but Lyris still had hesitation in actually bringing the Vanner to war training. She loved him, and wasn''t sure what she would do if he died in the heat of a battle. Nonetheless, she spoke. has always been an excellent She stated, factual, voice void of emotion. I have yet to begin training him. I''m more knowledgeable about general horse care and riding, and only know so much about war training.

I think he might work well with Kenyon, only since Ulric is more docile and could learn some spark from my She couldn''t help the faintest of smiles at the thought, still watching Ulric''s dark eyes carefully.

He sprung back up twirling his spear. The weapon flew into the air. Safely landing into the master''s hands. His spear pierced into the earth. His son had stood up and applauded.

But still she wished that he would choose to go on, as the time it took to the border would be lonely with only Buckeye there for company. She took it as a good sign when Kado asked Seeker to walk again and began to turn in various directions or tell the dapple grey stallion to stop or start. Her smile widened and she nodded. A tap to Buckeye''s sides made the buckskin stallion prance a few steps forward at an almost trot. That was precisely the reason that Veri had given Seeker to Kado for this firm tug on the reins let Buckeye know they weren''t going for a run.

Of course Kado would probably experience being dumped on the ground eventually, but today would not be that day. She''d make sure of it. Upon being told to lead the way with a nudge to her mount and a slight turn to move past the stables and to the entrance of the outside Veri moved Buckeye to head slightly west to find the road that led out to the border. Their direction set for a while, the cream furred wolfess drew in a deep breath of the outside air and turned her mixed blue eyes onto her friend. curious, what were you doing when you were taken in? Just wandering looking for mischief, or did you have a place in talk, she''d found, passed the time by much faster than only silence. Even Buckeye calmed a little, although his ears still pricked to and fro as he gazed around; it had been several days that they had all been trapped inside the Courthouse. She was honestly surprised that even Seeker was not antsy to be free, but the dapple stallion only held his head a little higher than normal to display his eagerness, calm and collected as ever for the new rider upon his to the last few days, the sun was warm on her flesh and let her hum softly with content. This is something she loved to do, ride out in the open terrain, the feel of a horse under her legs. Soon even Shasta would be able to enjoy the pleasures of being ridden over the land at a gallop, the wind snapping at his mane and tail, ground disappearing behind him in the dust kicked up by his hooves. Buckeye felt her excitement again and tossed his head while he her hands sawed on the reins to tell the buckskin to behave, but he just shook his mane so it lay in every direction down his neck and chewed on the bit in an attempt to get it between his teeth. With a sigh Veri turned Buckeye so he began to circle Seeker widely. worry about me, Seeker will keep walking for you no matter what I do, you''re his rider for the day and he''ll obey only you while you''re in the saddle.

It was an effort to keep him at a very bouncy, lengthy looked at her reproachfully as if she was betraying him, but huffed as Buckeye continued to make large circles him while he walked forward. Veri grimaced as she gave up attempting to sit his trot and started to post, essentially bouncing up out of the saddle with every other stride that he took beneath her. It took almost no effort to do so but looked odd in the western saddle, not that she cared how it looked, it was simply more comfortable to her in this instance.

Hunting', many days could go by in this Nyx pondered. When the young wolf had arrived in this territory, she was petrified of everyone, could barely speak, or eat. Meeting Bec back then had helped the adolescent grow. She''d learned to trust, to fish, to heal, but the white furred young girl had not seen her adoptive mother in so long, she believed it was time she start doing things for herself more. Nyx had grown a bit physically since then as well, but the lack of nutrition she had received in those vital stages of her growth had slowed down the process, maybe even stunted it for good, she didn''t know, or if she did she wouldn''t let her size hold her back. Bec was a giant compared to Nyx, she was strong and well built, and she had wanted to become a warrior, well now it was Nyx''s time to join the ranks on Anathema, and she''d decided to follow in the paw prints of her first ever friend Nyx said softly to herself, looking down in disappointment at her own two thin arms, one of which was heavily scarred and nearly lame. The girl then clenched her two fists in a bit of determination and stood up from where she sat outside the main entrance to the howling caverns where she slept. don''t wanna be weak The girl thought to herself, if I go hunting more I''ll get stronger, but it cant just be rabbits and field mice anymore, can and with that, Nyx headed out towards the forest south of the cavern''s was a bit of a trek there but Nyx didn''t mind the exercise. She was stretching her legs for once, and this time she was determined not to have to be carried by any Luperci that happened to see her. Bec, Amorette, Lukos, these were the kind faces Nyx had had the pleasure of meeting in her short time here, and they had all pitied the young girl and had all carried her when they saw how thin and small and scared she was. They had all said they''d protect her, but today Nyx felt the need to become stronger, so that one day she might be able to return their kindness. Nyx was yet to even be a year old, but her birth family was gone, and she had to learn to do things for herself one way or her way into the woods, Nyx suddenly realized her situation as she looked down upon herself and came to the realization that her pristine white fur practically became illuminated against the darkness of the earth and the trees. Nearly rolling her eyes, the little girl sank to her knees in the dirt and picked up a hand full of the greyish earth beneath her, crinkling her nose as she began to rub it over her fur.

What they needed was a devoted herdsman to move them from place to place throughout the day and ranging far and wide to keep them happy. Caribou were wild creatures, as docile as they appeared at a distance and to keep them healthy they needed to move. It was one of the reasons Theon never kept Blitz tied anywhere. The reindeer walked and ran places and Theon would feel bad for his friend if he tied up somewhere to wallow in looked at the group and could agree that they were ready to go.

She would find him with his empty eyes staring up at the altar blankly, for he was lost inside of his mind. He pictured the scene for which he described before: a blood stained altar, complete with arm and leg straps, and a darkened leader, who probably looked like Beelzebub given he was actually a living wolf-form. there was no breeze, Belial hadn’t scented when Vesper came into the chapel, and he started when she actually spoke his name.

The three parallel marks were from a feral fight, but the worst came from when she was unable to defend herself on two legs and ended with her being kidnapped.

Euphoria had taken Devon out that day to take a ride around her camp, remaining close where her slave’s scent was strong enough to soothe any worry of having to face any incoming danger alone. monochromatic woman hurried her large steed into a swift gallop. She enjoyed the feeling of freedom and power the strong beast gave her while riding, his massive body so steady and strong it almost felt impossible to be threatened by anything from his saddle. Devon was indeed one of the best horses she had ever had, his name a honour to her sibling which had led her into de adventure that was now her eyes scanned the surrounding area, her trained gaze searching for friendly travellers or dangerous intruders alike. The woman caressed her poisoned weapon attached to her hip, hidden and ready to unsheathe at any given moment. She was confident in her ability to maim and kill with said weapon, the ornate dagger being between the favourite of her collection. Luckily there would be no need for aggression that a trader and a wealthy one in fact, Euphoria possessed a wide variety of weapons both for personal use and for trade. She had been taught to utilize almost every type of blade accommodated to her size and build, the larger swords and rapiers reserved only for those who could offer a trade good enough to purchase them. a couple of hours she brought Devon to a halt and turned around to return to her camp where the Italian slave waited for her. Her ears swivelling on top of her head as the strange lack of sound caught her attention, stopping her in place.

She still was uneasy about the young male becoming Angelo, but she supposed that she wouldn’t be around all the time to save him from doing stupid shit. While she still was iffy about Aeron and what she had done when they confronted her, her eyes rested upon the woman and Kentaro. She laid upon Itzal, but she could feel him getting restless watched as Aeron struck the boy’s paw pad, the smell of blood quickly filling the cavern. Kentaro snarled, but Aeron remained calm. She handed him the dagger, and spoke some words. Finally, Itzal turned to her, it ok if I leave? I’ll be outside the caves when you come out. I don’t think it’s the place for me to stay He nodded toward both Aeron and Kentaro, and Axelle nodded as well, resting her eyes on his black, scarred face. see you outside, Itzal licked her lightly on her cheek and ducked out of the cavern to follow the rest of the pack out to do their own things.

He smiled playfully; he could admire someone who wasn''t bothered by taking what they wanted, when they wanted it, if it was an Infernian -- even if it was a bit out of line for his own personality. Subtly he inhaled to take in her scent to know more about her, though her soft, quick voice coupled with a sharp tongue told him some. It smelled like she was almost always in Inferni territory with the way the pack''s scent almost coursed through her very veins. There was also the smell of earth, of nature and life. It would be a complete lie to say she smelled unpleasant, he couldn''t get not even a faint whiff of alcohol or any other strong, gross odor on the was short too, that''s what he noticed first about her appearance. Ehren was no large tower, only barely passed as normal-sized because of his heavy dog heritage and the mix of coyote. Despite the fact that some wolf remained within him it certainly hadn''t contributed to his proportions very well. One could compare her fur to a night at the rocky beaches of Drifter Bay, varying colors of whirling sands with hints of darkness. Her eyes were intimidating, as confident as her posture was. The doggish hybrid''s ears had been perked in the direction of the stranger, eyes narrowing for a second not in a guarding manner but in an examining one. It hadn''t taken him long to assess her, just as she began to open her mouth after making eye contact with him. He tuned in to what she was saying, taking in her He replied to her question with only enough hesitation to save himself from appearing rude, he was getting used to hearing that one, but didn''t mind it -- it made sense that other members were curious. It would fade over time, as he showed up more and more around the territory. name''s Assuming she hadn''t been around long enough to hear his conversation with Maddox if she was asking that, he offered his name again. Ehren''s attention remained on her, ears persistently pointed to the female. His eyes, though no longer squinting still followed her carefully. He did not appear to be watching her as one would watch their enemy or someone they were suspicious of, but of someone that they were unsure about in a lesser manner -- didn''t know if they meant to mock or compliment was not as extreme as the rift of confusion that the question ''are they friend or foe'' brought, that question in some ways could still be applied in the way his shoulders were a tad more tense than they had been when the coyote had entered the room. But it was watered down a significant amount. Raising a brow, a light smile dancing on his lips, he then casually lifted an arm, gesturing to the acquaintance. The cook had called her ''Snap'', but he doubted that was her full name, the slim chance that it was he would know by her answer, if she would choose to just tell how long she had been here, nothing more. Ehren also wondered what she was doing in the Mansion, of course she rested here, but why had she chosen to show her face to the two of them? The brown black mix was curious as to what the woman was up he didn''t know how to insert that kind of question into the conversation at the current time, without coming off as eager or nosy, or perhaps both, and all three of those choices were undesirable. So for now, the male stayed quiet and awaited a response, Maddox shook her head at the two, without looking up at them. While the green-eyed older coyote had kept her mouth shut while working at her dish, it was almost finished and she felt the need to drop in a little quip at the small tenseness in the air around them, even though she could tell by Ehren''s expression he had created said air on accident. you guys are really brightenin'' up She said, sarcasm dripping heavily off of the words. Ehren''s eyes traveled to her, confused for a spot of a moment before grinning Miss, He trailed off, uncertain what her surname was. But didn''t I just tell ya a near second ago to only call me Maddox, Maddox supplied, there was no real venom to her words, though she had a smart mouth she rarely meant anything by it -- well, to pack mates, that is. The chef thought as the male''s grin grew even more, scratching at the back of his neck in slight embarrassment. don''t you two run along? Snap, you have somethin'' in mind for the day, do you? Take this poor pup along with Her head bobbed in the direction of Siegrist, who blinked. He had no plans for the day but wasn''t sure about this Snap''s feelings on him, potentially she could have grown dislike for him already. Ehren wasn''t necessarily an insecure person, far from it, but he was also a long way from being detached from the normal social not been a stranger to his ego being knocked down a peg, that lesson had been learned when he was a kid. Ehren wouldn''t say he was abused by any means but he had been bullied by his brother, it was just a natural thing to expect when he''d also been the only one interested in something more than the trading town. His sisters not so much, Lacie, his sibling that had taken on the surname he had, that of his father -- had teased him but never smashed his head into the dirt or broke his arrows like Raymond would. A small amount of anger surged within at the memories, and he schooled it before it had chance to bloom enough to show on his face. That was behind him. The male was content with leaving the past in the past, besides, in that time they were still considered pups, had just learned to shift and think their own thoughts.

Though, the cat hadn''t put too much of a fight, he''d been out numbered anyway. It was a hard life for those without hands, Nero wondered how any canine lived without becoming a luperci. It was beyond him, but skinning an animal was something he could certainly do and comprehend. returned, it hadn''t been a good day for the horse, or him, but it had been an accomplishment nonetheless. He didn''t know of anyone else beyond his sister who had skinned a horse before. stallion, it had gotten sick though and taken a turn for the worse. It was great practice though, a tiny cat like this one is no big big wolf wanted to share the effort, but without twine and somewhere to hang the animal, it would simply be more difficult to share the task. Nero could work swiftly though, cutting skin away from flesh and fat. Normally, predator meat was poor taste, too chewy and much too close to another wolf''s flesh. There were fatty parts that still were rather tasty. With knife in hand, he sliced along the fatty belly, pulling up a long strip of meat when he took his knife away. Nero brought up the tidbit and quickly ate it, enjoying the raw flavor of the meat. another strip, he offered it to Esmeralda. shouldn''t too much murmured as he made a few more deft cuts along the cat''s neck and up to the base of the skull.

Perhaps her pack, being one full of artists and the like, would find a better use for it. want you to have the Nero asserted, making the finer cuts around the eyes and lips.

truth in your lies.', had made a decision earlier in the week about which tier she wanted to pursue. Perhaps there was an assumption that she would follow faithfully in the footsteps of her parents to enter the Domestic ranks. Certainly it had occurred to her and she had thought that was where she go, if she was to follow true to her bloodline. It was a bit of a catch-all that didn''t include much that interested her. Sure, she was of sewing and cleaning. She had been taught proper manners, reading, and writing. She had also been taught three languages, though, and had an ambition for adventures that would not be met as a Domestic member. No, there was a tier that interested her far more. Labor was far too... well, laborious and Military was too aggressive for her tastes. So the clear tier had occurred to her: it was that she knew she needed to dive into her studies further, if she was to be a proper information gatherer for her pack. Valencia had formulated a plan of how to start her self-training in this tier (for to her knowledge, no one else was even the tier currently) and what she would need to do. First things first, she needed to be familiar with their own borders. Then she could expand beyond that to other territories. She cinched her belt around her waist with her dagger hanging lightly against her hip. Though she wouldn''t want to use it - and really, didn''t have the knowledge to use it properly - the blue-eyed Courtier wanted the silent threat to be there if she needed it. After all, she was going to the borders where loners might be. Perhaps, soon, she could get a sword and her father would teach her to use it properly so she could defend herself. If she was to be in the Information tier, she would need to know how to take care of herself on diplomatic mid-afternoon, she had been walking the borders for a few hours and so far nothing of interest had happened.

there''ll be some blood, no doubt about it', Jindo breed was known for its loyalty, and had been prized by the humans that had inhabited the Korean peninsula before the luperci virus had destroyed human civilization. The quality of loyalty had bred a closely knit community back in fighter''s home country, and it had only been the Crow Wolf that had disrupted the pure-bred pack of dogs. TaeKyung''s genes were overpoweringly wolf, as if the Crow Wolf himself had had a part to play in her genetic make-up. But the loyalty of her dame''s genes remained strong. It was perhaps that trait that had caused a young TaeKyung to depart her home country shortly after beginning her martial arts training, to steal the book-- now lost to the sea-- that had revealed to her the techniques of Taekwondo. Perhaps it was that same loyalty that had pushed her to pursue the traces of the Crow Wolf-- only to find that he had been destroyed. The ashes-- the branding-- the dead end to her search. But...even departed from the world of the living, the Crow Wolf followed her. He was fed by the dark blood that ran in her veins, fueled by her dreamless nights, and trapped by the pieces of the shattered mind. TaeKyung was most loyal to herself-- to her training and to fighting. To TaeKwondo. But that same loyalty that her Jindo blood compelled was given fully to the female wolf before her. Taller than TaeKyung, the fighter wondered if she could defeat Salvia in a fight now that she had her strength. But she felt no compulsion and instead...was compelled to follow beneath her and her alone. so she would have bred had Salvia requested, and she would have born pups despite her feral desire to fight. It was not that the Jindo-wolf was weak and viewed herself as a lesser creature-- to the contrary, TaeKyung was confident in her standing. It was simply that Salvia was her master. But it seemed that Salvia did not yet require this of her, and the shattered mind was left untroubled. For now, the fight was all she required. The fight was her reason to live. To be the best. For Salvia. And Salvia herself desired it to be so. was the only response she gave, her voice quiet, but strong, even in the darkness in her master''s eyes drew the Korean in. The tenebrous fae wanted a taste of that darkness, she wanted to reach out and touch it and feel it, to devour it and make her own inherent darkness deeper. Suddenly, TaeKyung was still as Salvia suddenly extended her maw. The sensation of the Tigress'' muzzle along her jaw sent strange shivers down her body-- shivers that were not manifested from coldness. To the contrary, the fighter felt herself growing warmer. Her breathing both deepened and quickened, somehow different than breathing upon exertion. The shattered mind could not comprehend the meaning of such things, for that instinct had been buried deep beneath the pieces of her mind. Perhaps now, that deep and basic instinct was beginning to re-emerge. As the hot breath was breathed into her ear, she felt a soft explosion of that warmth deep and low in her gut. A soft whine-- or perhaps a quiet moan-- escaped her throat. Was it confusion that caused that sound? Or was it that deep, unfamiliar feeling that stirred within her? The pale woman''s words drifted to her ears, the dark, black tone of her voice comforting to the feral one. Her body seemed to relax against her master''s touch. A soft growl was emitted from her throat, a sound of agreement. For some reason, words would simply not form upon her foreign tongue. But she felt-- intimately-- that what Salvia said was true. TaeKyung belonged to Salvia still. she managed to breath. And she could not contain her stillness any feral fae pressed into Salvia''s touch upon her stomach. She moved forward, pressing her body against her master''s. The shattered mind was conflicted-- was she submitting, or was this something else?-- but the husky scents that filled the air was strong. The fighter let instinct move her. She arched her neck forward, pressing her leathery nose into the side of Salvia''s neck and breathed in deeply. A barely audible whine escaped her throat. Swiftly, her voice grew harsh as a growl shuddered from her throat. Without permission, her hands lifted. Strong fingers pressed into her master''s hips, moving up slowly, drawing her master closer. White teeth unsheathed and pressed against Salvia''s black skin, soft and gentle bites scraping the softness beneath the pale coat. Her body relaxed-- and then the sinew bunched and tensed as if unsure of how to proceed. Vaguely, the shattered mind was aware that she had pushed the boundaries by touching her master without permission. But the shattered mind expected only that Salvia would demonstrate her dominance. The fighter was ready for that, for she had heard the dark, jagged edges of Salvia''s voice and welcomed it with her fighter''s soul. But the insinuation of that heat that had began deep down and now spread to her high cheek bones was not yet mean... weird is good courtesy of Stock Free Template by by background-position:top center; background-repeat:no-repeat; solid auto; text-align:justify; b p auto; background-repeat:repeat; text-align:center; font-style:italic; text-align:center; text-align:center; font-style:italic; text-align:right; auto; padding: '', '',

Red the rose.', 'At this point, she wasn''t really planning to mull over it too in-depth. There was more of an interest on her part to keep her skills to herself and to her pack. Some saw them in action, but she wasn''t ready for all of Cercatori d''Arte''s enemies to know of her ability. Not that they had many, but she was disinclined to go public as it were. Maybe she could be convinced, but so far she was far from it. Brisco was cute, but that didn''t change her nature or her interest in entertainment. That wasn''t her girl would have been amused to hear he was worried about sleeping around in the pack. Personally, she found it easy enough to physically enjoy herself (in many manners) without investing her heart into it. So far, anyway. Secretly she might have longed for something more than that, someday, but she was not wounded by flirtation or more without a purpose beyond enjoyment. After all, she had engaged in similar things in the past. Visually, she found him appealing, and his intelligence seemed average or above average. Certainly he was not boring her, despite his desire to steer her away from learning his fire bending. Perhaps that appealed more; he was drawing back something she wanted and so she would pursue it. Either that or she would find her own way to do it. It would be best to see someone else applying it skillfully first, like her and I will get along Esme said, her teeth flashing wickedly as she heard Nadir was particularly good with knives. Maybe they could teach each other tricks; it would be good to meet someone else who knew skills similar to hers. Commiserating with her mother was great, but expanding that kind of knifing network was invaluable. I''ll have to continue to disagree with her on you being an the girl said with a humored flick of her tail.

the wasp', low, half growl was all he gave in response to the others snappy response, more then a short grunt then anything, deeming the response unworthy of even one actual word. Unfurling his arms, he was already feeling like he needed a drink or some more tobacco; which wasn''t normal for him, having only partaken substances during festivities and the like, not as a means to calm emotional again with the sound effects, the hybrids eyes flicking to the males left arm for a moment, irritation building as usual from the red head''s short manner. It was infuriating that Nate was so wish washy with him, once more he reminded himself he''d been rejected by this guy, his advance submitted to in tugged back showing teeth. Rejection he could live with, being ignored he could live with, but being given the cold, indifferent front, whilst the fiery male went out of his way to save the hybrid only to swap back to indifference he would not tolerate. It was like he was being intentionally toyed with. Long legs crossed the space, a dark hand reaching out and snapping closed around the male''s left arm, his touch careful of the wounds but firm, the hybrid drawing his face down to the others. know, if you have an issue with me Nate, you might as well say so now.

and Round We Go', need to release what you''re feeling inside... WC ...Let out the beast that you''re trying to large black male had managed to tear himself away from his latest obsession - Elissa. The crimson female had captured the majority of Kai''s attention since her joining as well as his time, and he was well aware that he was shirking his border patrol duties because of it. Since Elissa''s recent bout of sickness a few weeks ago, Kai noticed she seemed to be a little more careful when it came to what she ate and drank. Kai remained unaware of Axelle''s involvement with lacing the welcome present bottle of wine with poison and he remained unaware that Elissa had worked out who had been responsible after the pack meeting Aeron had gathered. So Malakai remained in the dark with it all, doing his best to simply ignore the black and white female. He had obviously heard of her promotion, had seen her position at the front of the meeting as she hovered alongside their golden Angela, and knew that she would still have a swollen ego because of it. had skirted around the edge of Anathema lands, ensuring there were no foreign scents, no breaches, no signs of intruders, spraying against a few trees as he moved to strengthen the pack scent. It was this exact thing he had been busying himself with as he approached Thackery Village. Sniffing at the treeline, sniffing at the ground, Kai wanted to be thorough. There could be no more scares, no more infiltrations, no more war. Not that Kai would shy away from a good fight of course, but for Aeron''s sake. He knew she didn''t want war, knew of the strength of the other packs warriors and weapons. Spraying another tree, Kai sauntered through the village, to the north eastern corner, approaching a small, abandoned play area, seeing the rusted swings and overgrown weeds that blanketed the area. It clearly wasn''t used too often. Kai meandered towards the merry go round in his bulky Secui form, bowing his head to sniff briefly at the equipment, letting his eyes cast over the other pieces that stood silently, aged and weather-worn.

a scene I render when you catch me wide awake', face to face with everything I float:left; really wasn’t sure what Vesper thought of her. The last time that she had even mentioned the female was when she was talking with Myrika about their relationship, and that was a bit of time ago. It seemed their relationship had fixed itself and she was sure the pups had their own help in that. Speaking of which, she had noticed the one that Vesper has with her. It was a little gray one with some orange markings. There sure was a bit of her mother in her. She too wondered who the father was, but since she was keeping the father of her own pups a secret, she dared not to jackal’s own pups had taken an interest into the other one and made some noises back to her. She looked down to them, giving them a smile. It was nice to see them getting along nicely with the other pups in the pack. Her golden orbs moved back up a bit as she noticed her leader’s gaze looking down at her pet. It was no surprise really. It seemed to be the thing that everyone looked at first. The whole clan must have thought she was crazy to carry it around with her all the time, especially given it was poisonous. She moved her smile from her pups to Vesper, don’t need to worry. He’s very tame. He won’t hurt you or your conversation continued to move right along. She was wondering why Vesper would be looking for a mouse. The only reason the princess would ever look for one is if she were to feed her snake, but he usually found his own food. It made things easier for her, so there was nothing to complain about. She spoke gently, been fine.

He would not hurt her, it just was one of those things that came around, spreading a better feeling of safety. With her wounds, Elody guessed there was not another choice otherwise. Large ears perked for the accented voice, relieved for now. His voice sounded like home, just a little bit. In walked a jackal, non-threatening and very kindly coming to the young hybrid''s aid. A warm cloak was pulled from his body, wrapped around her. How could she ever thank this stranger for his kindness? Enveloped in the warmth, the hybrid beamed a grateful smile. Maybe it would be a couple of days before her return home, at least it would not be spent in complete scent of blood could have possibly drawn others to her location. Sure enough, that this man had found her under similar circumstances. She could only hope her previous opponent could not find her in the same way.

El shuffled a little in pleasant surprise as the little bird companion he kept fluttered and skipped along her feet, appearing to size her up.

It had caused Mirutes to end up parting ways with the band as well. The small jackal had waited for the other''s return but it hadn''t happened and so Mirutes had stuck out on his own to find Machidael since no one else had seemed interested enough in finding out what had happened to him and where he had disappeared to. And it had taken awhile for Mirutes to find him again but so far it seemed to be worth other had listened to him and gave him a small amount of privacy with which to shift and dress himself even if Machi had already seen it all before. He had thought Machi might try to fight it so he was pleasantly surprised that the other had actually listened to him.

That is if Machidael even realized what to wear them would moved close to Machi again, allowing him to take the rings if he would wish to further inspect otherwise Mirutes would end up having to carry them.

Last Minute Worries', solid border:px solid border: solid background-repeat:repeat; WC: had seen the affection pass from his mate to the black wolf, he had also seen it returned, and he didn’t like it, not at all. But, Augustus rarely liked anything. His smile, his laughter, were things that seemed more myth than anything else, and were not easily won. The snow and shadow creature knew his mate’s temperament was much unlike his own. She thrived in the company of others, but that didn’t mean he was going to let the affection pass so freely between them without comment or consequence. He was a male from another pack, one that New Dawn had troubles with, they had stolen Deuce away from them-- a woman that the stoic male had a soft spot for. His mother had been an arctic wolf, much like Deuce, but where Augustus’s mother had been cold and calculating, Deuce was soft-spoken and gentle, woe-begone, but a overall a caring soul. She’d first told him what it was like to be a luperci, she’d taught him letters, the little scraps of knowledge he held on to, even now. Though not the most intelligent creature, he was a quick study...when he was interested. The marks in the dirt, the strange symbols she’d explained to have a meaning-- his name, had piqued his interest, and he’d committed them to memory. had been drawn to Deuce’s gentle light, like he’d been drawn to Ciara’s own. He was the shadow and she was the fire that brought it into being. One could not be without the other. Without her light the darkness would swallow him whole, without something to cling to for hope. He wasn’t aware that this Malakai was much the same. The black wolf was already far too close to his mate, if he wanted this meeting to continue peacefully he’d have to back away first. The doe-brown orbs of his love fixed him in their gentle embrace, and the yellow of his irises retreated from the black secui form to meet them, subconsciously drawn to them without hope of ignoring their pull. Threat or not the male was displeased with the whole situation and he would be sure to let them both know it. Which they both did, the male wasn’t particularly good at being subtle. His gaze inevitably returned to the black halfling. never said he was Augustus growled in reply to his golden mate. She hadn’t mentioned he was male, either. The yellow of his gaze narrowed. Was she expecting him to thank Malakai? The Beta snorted. Augustus didn’t thank anyone. glanced at the blanket, his lip curling a little more apparent now as he did so. His pups didn’t need this human luxury, though it did look warm he glared at it, eyes returning to Malakai’s own as if to accept the wordless challenge. The Beta wolf was a large male, though he had such little fat on his body anymore, his muscles had never been stronger. These were hard times, and his body showed it. She rubbed her flank against his, but it did little, even less once the Anatheman spoke for himself. Black rimmed ears were forward, and he stood even taller, even in his lupus he was a wolf to behold, as short-lived as it was. As if to rise to the challenge of the dark wolf’s presence the Verto’s form began to bulk up. Augustus’s body was something volatile, ever since his first shift it would often change form and shape with little warning, whenever his temper flared too high. His secui was never far from the surface, no matter how hard the wolf tried to suppress it, his body didn’t want to heed him anymore. This disturbed him in the beginning, but not anymore. He was used to the sudden shifts, even when he shouldn’t have been. remains to be He said darkly in reply to mention of not being a threat. ear twitched dismissively on top of his larger secui head once the shift was complete. He’d decided to ignore the blanket. His pups could do with the extra warmth, as the winter was not yet over and their pelts would not be thick enough yet to ward against the cold, but he didn’t like the thought of them relying on a human luxury, no matter how miniscule it was. They would be wolves of New Dawn one day, not wolves of the plush southern packs. don’t speak for Zalen, and I don’t care He growled, the wolf had never bothered with the other packs, merely making appearances where it was deemed necessary for him. His larger secui body moved from Ciara’s side to her front. He wanted nothing more than he chase this male away, but neither could he risk Ciara getting hurt. This aggravated him, and neither his posture or pelt relaxed. can leave it here, and back The brute could stay if he wished, talk to his mate, even, but he would back away first, and Augustus would remain.

She stood straight at his spoken words and gave her own greeting, a simple single word that left him dangling on what may come next. she added her name, as Oak was only a moment away from reaching out for it. He smiled back, and nodded slightly at her explanation. There was little resemblance between she and her brother, only a hint in her scent that he only now recognized.

Get Off of My Back', Optime is by Alaine! afternoon saw Temeraire moving towards the sparring rings that had been marked out for the hand to hand combat. It was clear that great attention had been given to the maintenance of these rings, especially the one that would be used today. Fresh sand covered the ground that looked to have been churned up so that the cold air did not cause an icy slick that would do nothing but damage the fighters before they''d even reached one another. Temeraire found himself perched on a fence, paws turned back to hook on the plank beneath him while rump rested easily on the top slat. With arms easily over his legs, hands loosely clasped together, blue eyes were fixed on the three wolves now in the vicinity of the rings. The large gold male was at least partially familiar- he''d spotted him on their journey over from the Court and thereby recognised the representative of his new pack. The smaller, slimmer red woman was therefore the Casa challenger, as the dark leader, identified as Jazper from some others talking close by, announced their names and alliance. Skoll Haskel- he had a name to put to the youthfully arrogant looked a little nervous, Temeraire thought as he approached the ring and stepped inside, as the red woman did also. It was an odd match, the Seigneur thought. The red woman was clearly dog-dominant in heritage and while the gold male appeared to have some also, it was clear who was bigger and stronger. He supposed, however, the fact remained that a smaller wolf could easily best a larger if their skill was greater. Thoughts such as these raced in the males mind as Jazper''s voice rang clear as a bell to start the didn''t seem to be immediate action- Skoll did not throw himself towards Neela (as she''d been named by the dark warrior), instead he took steps back to give himself space. The woman denied it, moving forward at the same pace. Of course, her feinting moves caused a flare of irritation from the shadow male- trickery of any kind was unjust in his eyes. Watching, the female was trying to lure the Courtier into a pattern, before she tried to trick him once more, feigning left before twisting right. Was it so difficult to fight straight up, without pretences?

the lines between real and fake', weeks and then months passed. With time it became easier for the male to be without the wolfess that had become his best friend. There were days were he wondered if she was okay, or if she was even alive out in the wilds of free and unpredictable lands. That was not what they had wanted, they had wanted a home. A place that could be their own, a pack that they could be loyal to. Cassia had needed to return to the pack that she had once been loyal to in the past. The Risna was not attempting to understand, and so he pushed the memories from his mind and fought them when they threatened to arise. axe had been nothing more then a tool in the past weeks after the hurricane, cropping wood as it had been designed to do. It was a sad existence, especially when he knew that it could be held with so much more power.

Hear me Roar', Chibi is by Requiem! hadn''t returned home at sundown when he knew it was his curfew. At first, the Virdings hadn''t become overly worried, but an hour after sundown had seen Saul pacing up and down in front of the fire, his mind racing with all sorts of possibilities. It was cold out there- while snow hadn''t fallen today, there was still weeks worth of snow piled up all over the place and the freezing temperatures were still prevalent. He''d never done anything like this before- while Sólieri liked to push boundaries with Jordheim, they''d all been good at returning on time. He supposed it was an innate fear of darkness that all pups had that pushed them back home before the sun had fully set. What if something had happened to him? He was stuck in a ditch, trampled by the sheep or worse? Stolen from their borders, never to be seen again. It was this thought that propelled the male from their home and out into the He called, his tone laced with worry. He knew that it might have been better to search Jordheim quietly- if Rúni thought he was in trouble, he might hide or run away. But the worry was churning his stomach and he couldn''t help it. His nose twitched continually- while the snow obliterated most scents, he thought he could smell a relatively fresh scent on the wind. Perhaps he was still in Jordheim. By now, the stars were twinkling in the sky and his breath rose, ever harsher, in clouds of vapour as he moved west towards Niernans. Perhaps Rúni had gone to visit his Uncle and cousins, as Sóli had the other week. Of course, the sunshine girl had returned to inform them of her whereabouts, unlike the wayward faint noise was all Saul needed to turn and head south- it might not have been Rúni, but it sounded startled and therefore it could well have been his son. There was no noise after, but he thought he was going in the right direction. The churned snow alerted him to the actions that had occurred here and he paused, nose twitching softly. The quietest of whimpers came from the snow and after a moment, the shape of two ears made themselves known above the line of snow. Saul dived forward, cream paws digging into the snow on either side of the pups body to lift him out. Don''t you ever do that again!

This will be bringing SL and IF into all the drama because of Zalen believing Wraith is a spy from AT and then SL thinking the same thing because she smells like ND. This will cause tension between and is currently allied to CdC and trying to form a friendship with SK. So basically, there looks to be a forming ally block of and if all goes well, guessing once everything is figured out and Wraith is returned to IF, and AT will buddy up as well, creating another ally I''m not saying this is all building up to a board-wide war, though I''m guessing that may be a possibility, but it does lend itself to a lot of between packs that would make for interesting plots not only between leaders but also members. I figured this would be a good place to discuss mini-plots or the larger plot or just to share information to make things more stream-lined for everyone. It difficult to keep track of what''s going in each others packs for large plots like this, so there ya go.', '',

Today is a new day', Oh don''t worry about it, some PP doesn''t do any harm maybe he should have actually spent a few extra seconds trying to figure out just the best way in which to more easily carry this ladder; but hey - it was certainly too late now was it not? He was not about to make Alistair wait for any longer than he already had, so he would sooner struggle than do such a thing as that - especially as it were no doubt better than anything else. Though even despite his distractions that came with carrying his ladder it did not stop Kira from taking note of the grin that had formed upon Alistair''s maw; this was certainly more than enough to cause something close to a scowl form upon the green eyed male''s features. Was Alistair actually trying to laugh at him while he were trying to carry this damn thing? Though it probably were not meant to cause insult to him, but all the same Kira could not help reverting to a near pup like behavior; muffled grumblings all that escaped him up until the point in which he were allowed to set it when he did - the green eyed male was more than tempted to simply kick the contraption; had it not been for the fact that it would no doubt hurt that was stopping him. Rather the alternative seemed like the more appealing option, who knew - just maybe he could find some way in which to torment the Lune; he would certainly have to consider that and see how it went. But for now he would just make himself usefull for as long as he were needed here, which for now wasn''t realy for the time being - but then; Alistair probably had to find the right spots in which needed fixing first right? had near gotten to the point in which were he was allowing his attention and gaze to wander for a time, or at least up until he were called forward and motioned to climb up the ladder to see just what the tawny male was concerned and talking about. Only upon reaching the top and the spot that was causing issues with these buildings did the reality of the whole situation begin to sink in, enough for a flicker of concern to spread across his features as his attention was tugged round and slightly down to Alistair. you need some more help then? More than just a few times It wasn''t quite a direct offer of help, but he could only assume that the Lune would get the general idea of his offer if not then he would certainly make sure to make more mention of mention of needing to pry the wooden board off to see the extent of this particular disease was all it took to get Kira to be about to climb down from the ladder; or at the very least he were about to until he were handed the hammer - Well, he was in the right place so it only made sense to stay where he was and do what was expected of him. So with the instructions he had been given and the right tool in paw did he wedge the hammer in before starting to tug at the board; though it probably took a few minutes but he did eventually just about pull the board '', 
We can''t slow down, we can''t hold back', 'Dook gave an indignant honking sound as the tiny shreds of grass fluttered down to blanket his rump. Ascher smirked before laughing aloud when the fisher cat shook his sausage-like body to free his velvety fur of the torn up blades. Dook was obviously appreciating the company Ascher was providing him since his return to Vinatta, and Ascher was more than appreciative of the large mustelid''s forgiving nature. Whenever a packmate or a family member approached him, Asch still half expected to be when Tyris appeared with a jovial greeting, Ascher looked up with a tinge of surprise collected on his features. He wasn''t one to look a gift horse in the mouth, though, and he quickly presented a broad smile as he got to his feet – carefully, so as not to dislodge his ferrety scarf.

He''d lost count of the number of times Major or Thofnir had snuck up on him now, and those were cats he lived with and could predict to some extent. Eljun flipped his fringe out of his eyes, which danced back up to Lochlan''s face. His nephew – the only nephew who had remained in Vinatta – appeared to have done some further maturing since the wayward Uncle had absconded on what was left of his stable family, to chase those who weren''t such stable fixtures in his life. Thinking on it now, Asch might have believed he''d gone half mad in leaving, but it also pained him to think that nobody had come back with him – just another loss, in the form of Archimedes, to add to the Lochlan offered his congratulations confusion gathered over the Eljun''s face like clouds massing before a downpour.

His eyes flicked to the hawk in astonishment when it flew to the woman’s shoulder. He raised his brows in a look of “That is your companion? You are very lucky. That is an exceptional bird.

A Bird In The Hnad...', 'Ascher beamed as the girls erupted in excitement not too dissimilar to his own – he had just had years in which to master his emotions, and even then it hadn''t prevented his own thrill at seeing the closest of his cousins again. Bran was the brother who had always been there for Asch, through every stumbling block and trial, and both of them had ended up with children they could truly be proud of, although he had a feeling from Bran''s reaction that both would put it down to the women in their agreed with Ascher on the mental capacities of the bird''s species, but the Eljun knew his cousin wasn''t the animal type and he nodded with an of understanding as the Aor explained.

He didn’t know where to start, it seemed they were all one puppy working their way to four silly little ones. It was strange how they all could think alike at this point, but he was certain they were all their own personality certainly. He did what he could to calm the pups from jumping at his face by giving them his arms, wiggling his fingers. He knew it was something he thought was silly when he was a attention was still on his step father who agreed to do the roof in exchange for a cage for the puppies; he tilted his head and cocked an ear in uncertainty. His mom would pitch a fit. Though he wasn’t sure how to make a leather cage either. Leather was pliable, cages needed to be sturdy and stiff. It was the wink that made him laugh a surprised laugh. “I’ll do my He said, though he wasn’t certain that it really was an offer to actually make a leather cage. The question caught Tyris off guard. He didnt’ expect Bran to see anything underlying in his expressiion, though it was out there for even a pup to see. He looked at his only form of a father, though he couldn’t tell if he felt Bran as his own father. It was his mother who took care of him as a puppy, or someone else when his father first passed away and she went into a depression, but she was there and Bran was around, but as a friend more than a father. Though his words didn’t seem like a fatherly concern but one meant for a packmate or a friend, or even a sort of uncle’s concern. That’s how Tyris felt, though he’d feel bad admitting it to the mate of his mother. He looked down at the pups biting at his lower lip, then looked at “I don’t know, just that my brother has a mate and pups, and now my mom has you and new pups, but… I guess I just don’t know what to do. I want to find a mate, but... He shrugged opening to the man, so his eyes once again traveled down to the playing pups. (c) @ solid .tspace p b '', '',

The forest formed a dark realm of temporary night. The darkness stole away the sense of sight, but for this reason, all of Dante’s other senses were heightened. He focused ahead towards the game, a lone moose, cautiously grazing. The moose was an older female, probably nearing her last calf, and the scars that lined her sides suggested that she had made it out of bad situations before. With the years of living and all of the close calls, the cow had grown wary of her surroundings. Her eyes constantly flickered back and forth across her the dark woods. watched the path before him just as much as he was watching his prey. It was vital to be careful where he stepped, as the forest was always trying to create some sort of noise. Dante had made a point to walk where the ground was slightly damp, flattening autumn leaves against the ground so that they didn’t crackle like a campfire, but also dry enough for him to not slosh or slip through the mud. Each movement he made was deliberate. Dante walked crouched close to the ground, distributing his weight slowly from heel to toe with every step. he was close enough, Dante prepared to strike. A single shot to the head was all that Dante desired. He couldn’t care less that the creature’s face would be mangled; there was no need for a trophy or any sort of prolonged suffering in his eyes. Unlike most of the hunters, Dante didn’t enjoy the kill. It didn’t bother him at all either, so long as it was over quickly, but truthfully, hunting was more of a duty than a pleasure and it was the only job he knew he could consistently perform well. That said, Dante did enjoy the chase. It was always a challenge to hide himself from the fine-tuned senses of his prey while growing closer, like some sort of dangerous game of capture the flag and it made adrenaline course through him. movement to throw his chakram was as natural to Dante as walking. He grasped the iron ring between his forefinger and thumb, holding it horizontally. In a fluid motion, he took a step forward, with one eye closed. One arm spread out towards his target, and his weapon going back behind him in the other. Continuing on with the step, his arms shifted places, gaining momentum before he released the weapon. It was a perfect shot, or so it would have been. At the last moment, a group of startled birds flew up from the trees behind him, making a loud racket with their fluttering and scared calls, and making Dante jump. Because of this, his throw was shifted only a tiny bit, resulting in the weapon scraping off a layer of skin across his finger, but even the miniscule change mattered in the long run. The chakram’s path was off centre now, moving in slowed time towards the moose. With her attention towards the startled birds, the cow was fully aware, in horror, of the lethal weapon moving her way. And even though she had frozen in shock, the weapon had skimmed by her, lodging itself several centimetres into the spruce trunk just above her head after taking a massive chunk from her ear. cursed loudly and rose out from under the brush- his cover was absolutely blown and he knew it. The cow broke into full sprint, crying out loudly as she tried to distance herself from Dante. Blood poured from the stub where her ear used to be and left a crimson trail for Dante to follow, which would soon be covered in his own blood. He had to abandon all of the class or skills involved in hunting, and simply revert back to the way that nature intended him to hunt. Dante shifted to secui form, where the beast was at his most powerful. He towered above any other creature in the forest, with muscles rippling as he chased after the an attempt to leave the realm of darkness, she breached the wall of briars, whose thorns had torn shallow streaks across her side.

The female kept looking about herself to see if anyone were nearby, she didn''t particularly want to be seen experimenting hunting like this.

She knew it probably wasn’t good to joke about, but since they didn’t actually intend to try to overfeed the chickens, it was probably okay.

I know most of um, the spots where they like to lay eggs, so I guess that makes it easier for Sometimes the chickens liked to change nesting spots, but it seemed like they mostly each used the same spot. When she first started, it took her forever to find enough eggs, but she learned after not too long. Aspen picked up the bucket in her mouth and hauled it over to the side of the barn so no one would trip over it. Her steps were a little awkward since the bucket was just heavy enough to weigh her front end down a little, but she was used to it. Jin or Joon will come collect the bucket Aspen said. Sometimes she took some eggs for herself to cook with, but usually she let them use them for whatever it was they did with them. She suspected that they used them to make foods to give to other pack members or something, but she wasn’t sure. you wanted um, you could take some of them.

Everly didn''t know how many times she''d visited the Ilje''i amegwoi since she''d been back – she no longer kept track of anything but the movements of prey and the passing of the days – but the thing had never moved.

Her amber gaze followed the other hybrid''s striking pink one, and upon realizing where it was wandering the dark hued female struggled to suppress a smile. She was aware of her appearance, and neither proud or disgusted by it – physical beauty had never been a big importance in her life. Propping a dark-coloured elbow on the other fist which was crossed still over the plane of her front, she placed a few fingers on her cheek, eyes bright. The other female possessed a rough kind of beauty that Svas couldn''t help but admire, but what really caught her attention were the eyes. The dark-hued loner placed great value in the power of the eyes, and the pure force emanating out of this stranger''s deep, unusual pink ones attracted the larger hybrid like a moth to a flame. Svasra lowered her gaze, and a half-smile escaped from her stoic countenance. Svasra recognized the pack name from an encounter with one of its members a while back – a friendly man named Gehenna. It was one of the first few pleasant encounters with strangers that Svasra had had. The name Delilah, however was strange and unfamiliar to her. “Delilah,” She repeated, tasting the name on her tongue. “Well, I''m Svasra,” Was added, and repressing a grin the dark hued coywolf ignored the second comment. “Of no pack.” She''d have to rectify that one day. Svasra woman thoughtfully watched Delilah''s reaction to the stallion''s movement, and made a quick note about it. If she needed to get out of there, the horse seemed like it would be the best option. “Well what am I supposed to do,” She snapped, having trouble keeping from smiling. “Where I come from it''s a private thing.” That was a pure lie. Svasra had had very little contact with other females, and never had she met another while she was in heat. She had experienced it herself a few times so far, the first time being with her uncle, who had an awkward time explaining it to her. They had split for a few days while he scouted ahead, to give them both excuses to be alone. But Svas had never been given the impression that it was some secretive occurrence. In an uncharacteristic bit of humour, the large coywolf flashed a grin and removed her fingers from her cheek to motion a bit with her hand. “Is that why you''re drunk,” She teased, eyes bright. “Don''t know how to deal with it?” auto; p text-align:left; .line dashed; font-family:''Gloria Hallelujah'', georgia, serif; p.ooc dashed; text-align:right; .wotd dotted; text-transform:uppercase; '',

(expansion coming History Before Sixx was born in New York to a family of dog extremists. He knew his parents, and he also was not born with the name Sixx. His real name was Beorc, with no last name or middle. He was separated from his family when he was very young. The story is not clear whether his parents saw flaw in the pure dog, and sold him into slavery or if he was kidnapped and forced into it, for he was simply too young to remember what really happened. He was about four months old when he was forced into slavery and trained to be a slave. While he was still a lupus-dog, he was trained to pull carts, and he was forced to shift a month before his six month birthday(which had made his body unable to shift all the way back down into his lupus form later on in life). Once he had shifted, he was sold to a Master and Mistress that owned lots of land and other slaves. His name was then changed from to because he was the sixth dog slave in the household that he served. He wears a collar and chain with ''SIXX'' burned into it for this Sixx started to become increasingly He was misbehaving, and trying to run away a lot, never really being able to get away because of the that his owners had placed around the perimeter of their land. He was forced into kitchen work for a month or so for punishment and when he took a knife and held it to the mistress'' neck, his arm was broken by the master of the land and then he was sold back to the slave traders who stole him from his parents. They helped him with his arm, and shipped him along to Freetown with a bunch of other was about months old when he was shipped to Freetown, and his arm had been healing fine. The slave traders took special care of Sixx because of his value. He was a rarer specimen on the market since he was pure dog and had a beautiful coat on him. They advertised him as a guard dog, and as a slave, even though he had pulled a knife on his last owners and they knew did they get His life was threatened when he would misbehave and soon he became obedient to a fault to his owners. When he was about to turn months, he was shipped to an outpost in Nova Scotia. His value was worth more than his loyalty, and they decided to part with the pest once He is primarily into the dark magicks. He has some knowledge of other faiths, and a vast knowledge of spells.

There was also the uncertainty over whether Colibri was the right friend to turn to; would she take Lilin''s side? Were there even any sides to this?

She yearned to push aside all the goodness within her and cut him with her words, possibly even tearing his actual flesh with her teeth. But she couldn''t. As cold and uncaring as she sometimes seemed, Iris really did have a soft side when it wasn''t hidden by her insecurities. Her dis-trustfulness, in many situations, had saved her from potential harm. It kept her from getting to attached and one day left, but it also held her back from ever forming any real didn''t respond to his scolding. Maybe the way she dealt with things made her seem like an unsavory character, but it had worked in keeping her alive this long. She didn''t mind if he thought that she was ignorant, or just plain stupid. Her upbringing and former pack were not all rainbows and butterflies as she often let others, and herself, believe. know of She said, looking up at him with hard eyes. She wasn''t stern, or even looking to tell a sob story. Her statement was completely matter-of-fact, and her face made her current feelings unreadable. is a reason we try and leave before our first heat It was true. After the female''s first cycle they were considered a woman. Some females became of the pack, and some were sold away. But both went on to a life of being degraded and often physically abused. It was something she had just come to accept. But her mother wanted better for her. Iris looked up at him, challenging him to stare back at her. whore, maybe. But by my own this point, she felt completely and utterly defeated. am not sorry I hit on There was no use in trying to use her womanly charm on him. He was damaged.

No matter what he could say, she knew that someone had broken him. She had a sense for this sort of thing. She knew she probably shouldn''t act the way she does with strangers, but she wouldn''t know the pain of the fire until it really burnt her. are bad people in this world..

So if you don''t try to steal any more of my stuff, and possibly let me up, this may be a rather pleasant It was actually very easy for her to look past him trying to take her things.

Historical Research', padding: font-family: verdana; Bad puppy manners pup’s head turned from side to side and she attempted to follow their conversation. She was quiet, but her eyes were big and curious. She didn’t understand much of what was going on, but still tried to get something out of it anyway. The tension in the air was cleared, somewhat. Willam still looked flustered as did Vesper, but whatever ''trouble'' the stocky coyote seemed to be in was no more. Though, the air around them was still awkward and Azucena could feel as Azucena was beginning to feel left out, Vesper turned to her and dangled a dead rodent over her head. The pup moved slightly to get a better look at the creature before rearing up and swiping a paw at its limp head. Its beaty little eyes were frozen open and it smell good. She wouldn’t mind taking a bite out of it right now. Zuzu giggled, while still continuing to swat at it. you get it? The small Lykoi girl flopped back on her rump suddenly as she lost her balance. She wasn’t used to being on two legs – and especially not in this form. She still pawed at the squirrel from a distance, while Vesper seemingly took her eyes off of her for a moment to look back at Willam.

It counts them automatically for you, then. An example of this can be found in Sie''s postlog m ... m Please feel free to quote the post and lift that example, though I swear there''s nothing different about that code than the code provided here! Also, remember, if you use the basic DIV shell in multiple posts, you only need to include the CSS once! That''s it! And then you can control all of your archives with one CSS, if you please! If not, and you want multiple different layouts for each character and you plan to customise each one, *PLEASE* remember to change your class names from .char to your character''s name or another unique identification, otherwise your CSSes will overlap and it will be auto; font-family:''times new roman'', times, serif; Main DIV control. This controls your base text. If you want a background or border, you can add them here. You can combine this with my pure css table tutorial, sort of, and set a background image with padding to make it pretty, if you want. li list-style-type: decimal-leading-zero; controls the list items and gives them padding on the top and bottom, padding to the left and right, and a leading zero on the list numbers. It also makes the font weight of the numbers li em serif; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; is so that we can use a different for our numbers, and have our actual list item content text differ from the numbers. COOL RITE? ol list-style-position:inside; This sets the position of the numbers inside; you can also have them display outside, if you like, which will push all of the text over to the right and separate out the numbers to the left slightly. I wouldn''t mess with the padding or margin unless you want to add spacing around your archive p your paragraphs a text indent. I generally only would wrap the thread description with a paragraph tag. If you want to give your thread description a little padding or margin or something, you can adjust those thread warning text color and weight. Please remember to mark your mature threads in their titles, the first post with the provided warnings, m ... m and in profiles, archives, and post logs. Anywhere you can give people a heads up about a mature thread is li a the links used in your list items. If you want all of them to display upper or lowercase, I would recommend setting it via CSS rather than manually typing it in capitalized or all lowercase, because it is far, far easier to go back and change things later if you use CSS to set such things. :) I typed all of the thread titles in my character archives as properly capitalized and just set the links to display as lowercase. Remember, the fact that the a tag is declared after the li tag means that only links within your list items will change; any links outside of this (e.g., where the Wiki Profile Detailed Profile links are) are not you want to use the little symbols, this controls their color and size. I like for the symbols to stick out from the rest of the text, hence the color. They also don''t look very good at smaller sizes, that is why they are set for Feel free to experiment, of course. .separator font-family:''times new roman'', times, serif; text-transform:uppercase; dotted font-weight:bold; text-align:right; is the separator control. Font variables and so forth. A note for the separators, you have to place them WITHIN a list item tag (li) in order for them to function properly for every instance except the first one, which is placed outside of the first ordered list tag (ol). An example of this has been done for you--please remember this, otherwise the separators are liable to break something somehow and you will have to rescue your codez and it will not be fun. serif; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold; the part''s font and Makes the part with your character name and the notes beneath it float to the left.

The bright start to the day had faded into a bloodless, anaemic screen of greys and whites. The slightest bit of colour came from the rolling dark clouds on the horizon, coming in from the Atlantic and full of anger. They were just visible over the towering piles of concrete, metal, glass, and plant-life that had once been the fully functional human city. The whispering trembles of thunder could be heard along the coast, building; feeding. A storm was coming, and it would not be gentle. in such awful weather, Galilani had opted to find cover in the nearest building that didn''t have a leaking hole in it. She had left Aniwaya early, following the coast. She had seen the storm cross the water, but had paid it little mind until the crack of the whip came, and the shower had soaked her. Crimson clumps of fur clotted against her skin, and her hair slapped against her face as she trotted urgently through muddy puddles and across piles of stone. With one hand holding her quiver strap, the arrows rattling with her movements, and the other grasping her bow, the scout quickly found herself crossing in to the bulk of the city. Buildings finally covered her on all sides, and as the wind switched direction to blast raindrops in to her face, the woman spied a suitable shelter up ahead. down, Galilani splashed loudly through the flooded streets. The scent of the stranger did not hit her nostrils until too late, washed away by the wind and rain. Pausing a foot or so from the doorway, Galilani looked up with soggy, sorrowful eyes. She found the coyote mid-prayer, and standing in the rain, the woman could do nothing but smile weakly and shrug. Had her skin not been ice cold from the rain, she might have reacted to the burning embarrassment upon her cheeks. she stuttered, leaving her maw part open as she trailed away from her words. She watched as water droplets fell harder and faster down her mane of hair. She could smell the almond from the beads, though it was faded; mingled badly with the now apparent, and overwhelming scent of salt and honeysuckle. Galilani''s brow wrinkled, and her gaze dropped apologetically. She rocked gently from one foot to another, trying to ignore the chill setting in. Her tail flitted anxiously, and the woman looked up briefly through her drenched, dark fringe, with big, emerald eyes. di-- didn''t see yo-- you she confessed, feeling quite idiotic in his presence.

She sighed, watching as water sprayed from the collective dampness within her face fur. wa-- was she paused, looking around for another suitable holding. The rain had gotten harder now, biting against her back and sides. She shivered unintentionally, and her hand tightened around the bow for comfort.

Sadness seemed to swallow her, but at the same time, her companion seemed just as bothered as her. She smiled weakly, finding his gaze as best she could.

Will Meet Again', Set on the August, set several hours after our Kira Khyrem thread? Munroe is currently in lupus but will get him to shift in next post or had been some time since the small group of feral wolves arrival to their allied pack of Casa and - for the most part - they had all but healed from their physical injuries even if their mental ones remained along with the general anger in which they may have felt for what had happened to them at the hands of those wolves who had dared attack them for no reason in particular. And although he were not often one to hold onto such seelings for any significant amount of time Munroe had actually dared to allow himself to continue to hold onto such feelings, to the point where there was that need to find some way in which to distract himself from such things. Thankfully there had been one thing that came swiftly to mind in the form of Khyren, the black pelted female that had traveled with them to this new land - maybe it were about time for him to go in search of her and see how she were doing after all that had occured. had been the young male plans when he had gone in search of Khyren earlier that day, though it had been when he had followed the female''s scent and in turn located the source that he had first located her before taking note of the fact that she already had some company in the form of a grey cavalier male. This was all that had gotten Munroe moving on with the intention of returning later to see her, thankfully it had not taken much for him to find something to do in order to spend his time until such a point where he could safely know that he could go find his ''friend''(?) and see how she were doing. given the fact that - although having been here only once before when he were a small pup - everything here were still relatively new to him and gave enough of a motivation for the young male to familiarize himself with all. Thankfully too it had been more than enough to consume a few hours of his time before Munroe even considered trotting back towards where he had last spotted Khyren and it would seem that he had headed back at the right sort of time. sight of the light grey male heading off to where ever it were he were going was all that the younger male needed to know it were a good time, so it had been with a small wag of his tail that the younger male trotted past his elder and towards the dark furred female with a small amount if caution and a little cheer.

It was the latter who came toward them this time while her sunlit curls danced behind her. Lilia smiled brightly for two reasons. One, she liked the Amaranthe girl, especially after her family graciously gifted the Salcedo with their horses. Two, there was nothing that compelled Rafael more than duty to his family, and their alliance with the Amaranthe family meant playing nice. Rafael would have to ask for a dance with Akantha.

At first, he had come here to hunt, but once his hunger was satiated with a rabbit, he took to exploring. He sought to find Carya - even if he didn’t want to admit it. His feelings for her grew and dimmed with each visit and each month that passed between them seeing each other. Belial hadn''t seen her in a while, not for a few months at least, and the flame that burned within his chest was slowly fading. She no longer fueled his addiction, especially if she wasn''t around for physical contact. And if Carya was no longer around to fuel his addiction, Belial reverted back to his old ways of promiscuous sex, sacrificial murders, and overall creepy could hear the footsteps of another, but being upwind, he couldn''t tell who’s they were. Slowly and steadily, Belial crept after the other, picking up a heavy, hand-sized rock on the way in It had briefly occurred to him that they probably picked up his scent already, and before he reached the stranger, he bent down to discard the rock in a quiet manner. The last time he carelessly threw a rock, his target became suspicious of him. He didn''t need that to happen again. closer her became to the stranger, the more casual he attempted to look. Once the scent was strong enough to tell him that the other was within the mile, Belial stopped creeping and began walking through the trees. He still remained calm and aware, almost like he wasn''t for this other person in the woods. When a goat bleated, Belial’s head snapped in that direction and he directly made his way towards the man and his from the cover of the trees with the rock in view, Belial acted as though he had come upon this man accidentally. he greeted kindly, wondering about the origins of the stranger. He wasn’t dressed how others would dress around here. Belial thought about making a joke about playing with his because Belial often did that when killing and cooking wolves, but he decided against it. The man looked hardened, and despite the hooved creature beside him, he seemed rather fond of it. Instead of walking ahead, Belial paused by the tree, looking onto the stranger with his bright curious orange truth, Belial was a little disappointed. It became apparent rather quickly that the figure he had been following was not Carya, and was some random that he would now have to make nice credited to p font-family:verdana; b font-weight:bold; text-align:justify; background-position:top center; background-repeat:no-repeat; solid auto; .inner .ooc font-family:verdana; solid font-style:italic; text-align:center; '', '',

All and everyone is welcome AT common training could feel his blood boiling, his lips curling to flash his sharp teeth as he grunted with effort in his training. And at the moment, the dummy he was beating up had Kentaro’s face on it as Toshi envisioned it. All this time, Toshi had suspected Viper getting a little close to Isolde, their sister, Toshi’s sister. But it was Kentaro who had been the one to do that, to take Isolde as his mate. There were plenty of women out there, why did Kent have to take Isolde? He already had a mate, mates in fact, wasn’t the Angelo already satisfied with jabbed two punches at the face of the dummy, pretending he was hitting Kentaro right in the nose before he spun around to give it a swift round house kick, making the practice dummy to fall to the ground.

For all the Tuyul cared, Kentaro was taking advantage of Isolde’s feelings, using her as an outlet for his own sick did he do it? How could he without Toshiro catching a whiff of it? There were so many questions spinning around in the poor Ganesa’s head. Perhaps, Toshiro loved Kentaro so much that he turned a blind eye to it, not believing that he could do such an inappropriate thing with their younger sister. That was probably it, Toshiro always knew that Kentaro loved Isolde, but Toshiro gave his elder brother the benefit of the doubt, that he would do the right thing. But Toshi was Anatheman Prince looked down at the dummy under him, its ‘head’ had been shredded to bits by Toshiro to the point that the head was no longer there besides the stuffing and bits of cloth that the dummy was made up of. Toshiro glared at it as he panted. He loved Kentaro and Toshiro would continue to love him just as he would continue to love Isolde, but it did not set right in the orange male’s stomach. It felt like he had actually swallowed a boulder the more he thought about his elder and younger was worried, worried that if Kentaro’s and Isolde’s partnership did not work out then it would rip apart their family. Toshi did not want that to happen, he did not want to be made to choose between his two most beloved siblings. Life used to be so simple, when did it suddenly become so complicated? It caused his head to pound let out a sigh before he got up and righted the decimated practice dummy back onto its stand and returned to his stance. The Prince had been training non-stop all day, trying to get his emotions sorted out. He wished he could be happy for his sister and brother’s mateship like everyone else was. But he wasn’t, it just put him off, like he could feel that something would go wrong. Toshiro had kept these thoughts to himself for what it seemed like forever to Toshiro, but little by little, the Ganesa male was growing tired of bottling up his emotions, his thoughts.

Running to the Warning Sign', is not much of a wolf-hater, but maybe Snap can show her otherwise? was not very fond of leaving Mariama alone for too long. Having the mare around had been a constant in her life even days after her arrival to Inferni, before her small travel companion and her moved to D''Neville Mansion. The even tempered mare was, to the coyote''s eyes, too peaceful to roam around free with unknown horses that could be a little bit to harsh when introducing her into the hierarchy, but Yari had calmed her down and convinced otherwise. In the end, his arguement deemed her fears as senseless, and she agreed to allow her to join the rest of the free-roaming mares. Day by day she realized that the closeness to other equines gave her new energy, which showed when she took her out for a ride. Today was no exception, and the pair found itself galloping back from an exploration trip in which Kasia looked for some prey. Today was her lucky day, and so she made her way to her place with her hands the air whistling in her ears and the beating of Mariama''s hooves, she managed to hear a faint howl, not very far away from where she was. Her first thought led her to ignore it and go on, but the fact that it sounded deeper, like a wolf''s voice, caught her attention. Of what she had observed, everyone around was almost entirely coyote, and wolves were not accepted under any circumstance. Probably a stray had mistaken this place for a wolf pack and decided to try his luck. Whatever was the case, curiosity took over and made her detour from her original route. As she galloped towards the borders, she saw another rider go in the same direction and win advantage over her with the speed at which it was going. The brown-eyed woman was still not fond of all the canines around, but she did recognize a few faces, and this one had been first noticed around the Mansion a couple of times. Still wary and not wishing to engage into any sort of trouble, she trailed after her at a safe distance and made sure to go unnoticed while still being able to see what was going on. And oh surprise, all that fuss had indeed been caused by a reaction of her packmate (the rider turned out to be a female) was the one that Kasia expected. With a snarl on her face, she demanded an explanation of this unwanted presence. Gazing sideways, the white covered in red of the skull fence stood out from the dun trunks like a sore thumb. The wolf was either VERY desperate or an airhead, for overlooking such an evident warning against his kind. But now that she looked at it closely, the shape of the skulls was a bit tricky, maybe he got confused. But in the other way, a territory with such level of hostility displayed towards outsiders was not to be approached so blatantly, it was indeed curious and it made her even more impatient to join the other two. After waiting for what she considered was enough time, she advanced forward, joining the blonde coyote in a row that stood between the stranger and the borderline. is going on she asked, her question adressed to both the local and the foreigner, even though she stared at the latter. A quick glance in the former''s direction helped her to evaluate how would she react. She hoped that the anger did not get discharged on her as well, just to save her some trouble. Her lack of experience when handling wolves from that side of the borderline was null, she could appeal to that in case that she was regarded as too lenitent or kind towards the species. But until then, she would observe and see what proceeded.', 'YAAg', '',

Hell how was he to complain if a young lass was addicted to him in every way. He felt odd thinking of it like that because it sounded too one sided. He was equally addicted to her and would pass up any female in heat just to get back to his lass. But as she went back to the instrument he already planted his lips upon hers. He gently stroked her cheek positioning hr hands on the metal wind instrument.

I introduce myself?', takes place in Mansion, around midday. If you need to change any details, just tell me winter coming, preparing the mansion was becoming an imperious task. Insulating the rooms and gathering bedding material kept the canines busy along with the greenhouse manteinance. Kasia took part on the former activities, searching for planks and materials to insulate both the common rooms, and her own in particular. Even though she was not very sensible to cold weather, she would not take risks, and so she set on looking after blankets and pelts for both her and her jackal first floor was unoccupied for the most part that day, and so was the storage room when she entered. The gardening and good gathering was probably calling most of the available working hands, but since she had gathered plenty of food the recent days, most of which she was trying to preserve to add to the stock, she guessed that some time could be spared to cover her own needs. Yari was out orking as well, door to the storage room creaked loudly as it closed behind her. Just like she thought, the place where the pelts rested had been recently assaulted. She examined the remaining ones and selected a couple which had a few small holes, but with fur still attached to them that would serve as bedding material. She turned around to leave, but the sight of the neatly kept supplies called her attention Maybe there would be something useful for her. Placing her items on the table, she then went to see the rest of the room. There were fewer tools than she had expected, especially having in mind the fact that the mansion required constant mainteinance. Also, she had heard rumors of a forge somewhere around the place. She hadn''t seen it yet, but assuming that they had it working, she would expect more tools adequate for it. Moving on, she picked up the available ones and examined them. They had a few hammers and other items that were way more adequate for wood work. Yari would probably like that. The more she looked around, the more absorted she got, and soon enough, she forgot about the pelts, and the fact that others could enter at any moment.', 'IAAg', '',

It counts them automatically for you, then. An example of this can be found in Sie''s postlog m ... m Please feel free to quote the post and lift that example, though I swear there''s nothing different about that code than the code provided here! Also, remember, if you use the basic DIV shell in multiple posts, you only need to include the CSS once! That''s it! And then you can control all of your archives with one CSS, if you please! If not, and you want multiple different layouts for each character and you plan to customise each one, *PLEASE* remember to change your class names from .char to your character''s name or another unique identification, otherwise your CSSes will overlap and it will be auto; font-family:''times new roman'', times, serif; Main DIV control. This controls your base text. If you want a background or border, you can add them here. You can combine this with my pure css table tutorial, sort of, and set a background image with padding to make it pretty, if you want. li list-style-type: decimal-leading-zero; controls the list items and gives them padding on the top and bottom, padding to the left and right, and a leading zero on the list numbers. It also makes the font weight of the numbers li em serif; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; is so that we can use a different for our numbers, and have our actual list item content text differ from the numbers. COOL RITE? ol list-style-position:inside; This sets the position of the numbers inside; you can also have them display outside, if you like, which will push all of the text over to the right and separate out the numbers to the left slightly. I wouldn''t mess with the padding or margin unless you want to add spacing around your archive p your paragraphs a text indent. I generally only would wrap the thread description with a paragraph tag. If you want to give your thread description a little padding or margin or something, you can adjust those thread warning text color and weight. Please remember to mark your mature threads in their titles, the first post with the provided warnings, m ... m and in profiles, archives, and post logs. Anywhere you can give people a heads up about a mature thread is li a the links used in your list items. If you want all of them to display upper or lowercase, I would recommend setting it via CSS rather than manually typing it in capitalized or all lowercase, because it is far, far easier to go back and change things later if you use CSS to set such things. :) I typed all of the thread titles in my character archives as properly capitalized and just set the links to display as lowercase. Remember, the fact that the a tag is declared after the li tag means that only links within your list items will change; any links outside of this (e.g., where the Wiki Profile Detailed Profile links are) are not you want to use the little symbols, this controls their color and size. I like for the symbols to stick out from the rest of the text, hence the color. They also don''t look very good at smaller sizes, that is why they are set for Feel free to experiment, of course. .separator font-family:''times new roman'', times, serif; text-transform:uppercase; dotted font-weight:bold; text-align:right; is the separator control. Font variables and so forth. A note for the separators, you have to place them WITHIN a list item tag (li) in order for them to function properly for every instance except the first one, which is placed outside of the first ordered list tag (ol). An example of this has been done for you--please remember this, otherwise the separators are liable to break something somehow and you will have to rescue your codez and it will not be fun. serif; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold; the part''s font and Makes the part with your character name and the notes beneath it float to the left.

happy kitty, sleepy kitty', 'On her way back from a mostly unsuccessful hunting trip turned exploration of the packlands, Aspen walked slowly back towards Jordheim. She wasn’t too hungry since she had managed to catch one fish while she was out, but luck just wasn’t on her side this time. Some days she was able to catch a bunch of fish, and other days, they managed to avoid her. She hadn’t been able to find any rabbits or other rodents, either. one fish would have to last her a little while. It had been a fairly good sized one, at least, so hopefully her stomach wouldn’t start rumbling anytime soon. As she reached the edge of the village, Aspen could see her packmates out and about, and she shyly ducked away from them. Sometimes she felt bad, and worried what they thought of her doing that, but she was still too nervous to talk to them sometimes. had come in from the south and passed several houses on the way to the one she had claimed. Her home was still mostly empty, even after the amount of time she had spent in it. Aspen just didn’t know what she wanted to put in it and wondered sometimes if it would be better if she went and moved into a den instead of taking up a whole house alone. Maybe someday, she could have someone live with her, strange as it would be. she passed the last house before her own, Aspen saw someone sitting out in front of it, and she recognized the canine as the one who had greeted her at the borders before Saul arrived. Pausing, Aspen considered whether she should just go up and talk to her. Chloé was very nice then, and after a few moments, Aspen spotted the kitten in Chloé’s lap, piquing her curiosity. She’d seen many wolves with cats in Vinatta. hi Aspen said quietly as she approached. Her eyes shifted from the kitten to Chloé and she smiled a little. are you '',

Thunder watched the male as he spoke, he couldn''t understand him at all but he could tell that he wanted to help his owner. Thunder watched as the male started to move around and build a makeshift sled, though he never left the charcoal females side much longer than just a moment. Thunder watched the mare walk over to them and he shook his mane in greeting. At least Thunder had someone to keep him company that he could understand now. Turning to look back at the male he had tied the makeshift sled to the mare and he nickered flicking his tail back and Snorting loudly Thunder walked over to his owner as the male lifted her. Calla could feel the males arms wrap around her and fear flooded through her very quickly, where was he taking her?! Once she was lifted the pain was almost enough to knock her out. Some how she stayed awake, finally opening her eyes letting out a weak whimper her blue hues looked around frantically. Her weak breathing was getting worse as her heart sped up, shorter faster breaths to the point of hyperventilation. She saw Thunder and she calmed down a little, looking at him she was set down onto the sled and she sighed She didn''t know where she was headed, but at least someone was there to help her. Closing her eyes again she could finally relax knowing that she and Thunder were going to be taken care of. She sunk into unconsciousness hearing him tell Thunder to follow them. Thunder shook his mane to scatter some leaves that had fallen into his mane and he took a few steps towards the the two wolves and the mare. Letting out a light nicker he sauntered over to the pretty mare and let out a soft snort flicking his tail back and forth. Are you participating in SuSo? '', '',

Other members of the pack- the ones that owned their own horses would stop by now and again, but the communal animals were all left entirely to the two of them.

It wasn’t something she was used to hearing – and wasn’t something that the birds were used to seeing. They all regarded her suspiciously as she walked underneath their trees slowly. She touched the bark of some, but kept going while her head darted around curiously. Every time she heard a different squawk, her ears followed the sound and her head snapped to its direction.

There seemed to be millions of voices in her ears, and Azucena couldn''t make out just one conversation. It sounded like a room full of voices, each having a different conversation with another. It was impossible to figure out just one. And then a raven approached her. It hopped down from the higher tree branch onto a lower one that was face level with her. The raven watched her quietly, with one eye. It hopped closer, and Azucena remained still hoping not to scare it. She wanted it to come closer to her, to investigate her.

Keep in mind that these hares are crepuscular, and most active during dawn and The stairs in the D''Neville Mansion are a constant source of worry, especially the more frequently used front stairway. Reinforce the stairs -- your character may have to open the walls beneath the stairs to add extra wood and boards, etc. Make sure to clean up after yourself and either remove all and make the open space look nice, or replace it with boards, name sure the horses and other livestock are prepared for winter, too: stockpile extra livestock feed, muck out the stables, and ascertain the health of each animal sure your fellow members are comfortable this winter. Present someone with a gift -- it should be of a practical nature and especially useful for the cold the worst of winter hits, warm patches of air make for a deadly storm of freezing rain.

Character Name: Lithi’um (Lithi for Character Birth date: Gender: Species: Canine, Australian shepherd Luperci DeviantArt or Lithi lived in a nomad pack which travelled along the coast of south Asia. Lithi had trained to be a hunter by his mother who raised him by herself as his father was killed before his birth. Even as a child Lithi spent a large amount of time by himself, never really fitting in, and finding himself spending a large amount of time exploring and adapting. After a bad trade, his pack was forced to leave their normal route and travel north into the cold lands of Russia. As the pack was more suited to desert and rain forests, they found it difficult to acclimatise to their new environment and gradually each member of the pack either froze or starved to death, leaving Lithi as the only survivor. Lithi’um now a six month old left on his own to care for himself in the harsh wildness; having aged three months in his travels to Russia. After putting his mother and the last of his pack to rest, Lithi travelled west into Europe in hope to find a warmer land. As a result of being forced out of his home and losing all he cared for in life, Lithi became more untrusting and so remained by himself as much as possible. He travelled through Europe simply trying to stay alive while hoping that one day he will find a new home and maybe even a new pack. By the age of eight months Lithi’um had reached the coast of Greece, learning about a possible home in the land of Nova Scotia. He slipped on board a ship which was sailing to the a number of lands including Nova Scotia, because of his size he made a perfect stowaway and his ability to go days without food and water allowed it so the food and drink he took in his time on board went without it being noticed. Almost eight months had past since Lithi set sail but has finally arrived in the land of Nova Scotia. Lithi doesn’t know what this world will hold but he plans to make the best of is an Australian shepherd. He has black fur, with tan points, white markings, on his face, collar, legs, chest and underbelly. He has dark green eyes which reflect in the dark, giving off the sense they are two glowing emeralds. Unlike many dogs, Lithi isn’t large but lean and graceful, giving him great flexibility and movement. He is slightly larger than five feet in height and weighing only He spends most of the time in his Optime form he does take on his Lupus form when he needs the added speed to escape danger. Lithi''s fur markings are that of the merle allele, which produces a mingled and patchwork combination of dark and light areas most visible on his face around his left eye. Though Lithi attempts to stay out of battle he has a number of scars, mostly found on his back, legs and arms. His claws have the appearance of ebony, shiny but black as night. However there is more to them than appearance. They are stronger. His teeth too are as of his claws with one exception, they are an ivory a result of his past, Lithi’um is very indifferent towards dogs but mostly wolves and so keeps away from them. Because of this long period of solitude Lithi is very stand-back when it comes to others. He is quick to flight and tries his best to avoid conflicts. Lithi is socially awkward and never seems to know what to say or how to act around others; as such Lithi will normally say things he shouldn’t, speaking his mind or missing hints given to him about what to say. This normally leads him into trouble; however one thing Lithi has picked up in his travels is an amazing level of luck. Lithi is in fact very lucky, finding things and escaping from problems most would think impossible. Sadly though he doesn’t see himself as lucky due to the loss of his mother and pack, because of this; making friends is even harder for him, even when he does build enough trust to talk and meet another, his inexperience when dealing with others makes him come across as rude. This puts others off and makes Lithi more cautious when dealing with others because he doesn’t need any more enemies.', '', '',

Deference to oneself is difficult in the face of such adversity, such ominous odds. In reality, he is nothing but a rangy, skinny youth; Hardly even an annoyance in battle to the Tigress, who controls the mountain golem, who controls the realm. She could eat him so if she chose.

The fog would aid his escape, but come the morrow she could track him through the forest, and he does not want the Tigress anywhere near Larkkin, not yet. It is too risky.

First Ayita, a woman he did not know well at all but knew as one of the matriarchs of the Court, passed away from her wounds. He was saddened that they knew so little and could not help her in her time of need other than to let her rest or feed her numbing herb blends. And then went the former Dauphin, the man he had himself disposed of from power and watched slip away from public eye like a cat slinking into the shadows. But he had wasted away and he had died of illness, and it seemed few were truly surprised of its coming. He had been ill and Silvano knew it had been time, young as he was. And then Vigilante. He was gone too, his King, the man who had taken in him and his mate when his own family had left for a far away land. And he was In his heart he was glad they were at rest now and suffering was no longer their enemy, peace now their ally. But the loss of two experienced - if wounded at heart - leaders was a blow. He was without a safety net and the new Queen would rely on him until she was caught up to speed. For now, he was the experienced one. Had he wanted to, Silvano knew he could have taken the rank of King, though it was not his rank to take. Vigilante wanted his daughter to have it and he honored that desire without a hint of remorse. Even though he was subservient to the new Queen, he understood that they were on mostly equal footing here, especially with the rest of the court at hand. said nothing as the Queen ran through her shaky first speech and felt pity blossom. Here was a girl fresh out of youth really, and she was trusted with all the safety of their home. Silvano would help. He would always help.

X’y was truly blessed to have such a long main in this form; Zalen’s one tresses receded dramatically in Secui, much to his chagrin. He listened as she spoke of how their arrangement had affected the family, and it seemed it was the same in Sangi’lak as it was in New Dawn. The Shepherd did however let slip the information that he had not been the only male to have mated with her, which did not surprise him; it was probable that the litter she carried was no his, but there was always that chance, and so the excitement she spoke of two certain males, X’ies and Jaden, two wolves that Zalen could not admit he had had the pleasure of meeting, his listened intently. When she mentioned Jaden having mated with an inferior beast, Zalen cocked his head slightly but said nothing; he knew of Sangi’lak’s belief that dogs and coyotes were inferior, a belief that was even more radical than New Dawn’s. Zalen did not fully agree with it; while he believed wolves, coyotes and dogs should remain separate, he believed they were equal when view in their unique contexts.

Kennedy transgender character', is a game but these people have to deal with this same bullshit every day of their lives. why do we have to remind them about the fact that they can go NOWHERE and feel like even when they''re playing a game. why can''t they have a single space in the whole world over that''s not judgey or bullshit or reminding them about all the shit they have to deal with in can. There are roleplaying that anyone can go to and test out their gender identity or their sexuality or whatever else they have in mind. There are plenty of places and people in the actual world that are accepting and don''t judge others. This is an absolutely overreactive statement and it isn''t true in the slightest. We are not the only roleplaying game in the it shouldn''t be an officially endorsed part of this game to participate in oppression of are not endorsing the oppression of Our OOC community is, always has been, and always will be a place for people to talk and to support each other. I make it a point that, if I see someone struggling in Open Letters or Updates Absences or I PM them to make sure they''re doing alright. is a difference between OOC and is, according to the dictionary, state of being subject to unjust treatment or This is not If we end up wanting to give a realism exception or whatever, then fine, but this is in with everything else we do here in ''Souls. This decision was made because we wanted realism and consistency, and to not confuse our other players. It wasn''t made because we''re also strongly diasgree someone who gets marginalized and shit on every day of their lives should be characterized as being whiny or sarcastic when discussing something close to their identity. can be whiny and sarcastic no matter what you''re discussing. I can get whiny and sarcastic when I talk about getting sexually harassed when I was very young, but I don''t give that as an excuse. I apologize and try to be more calm and reasonable because talking in such a way is counterproductive, doesn''t convey ideas well, and doesn''t get anything actually accomplished. Being respectful and reasonable is important. I will always stand by this no matter I am there''s a cross between OOC and IC or maybe I''m making this too personal but honestly, oh well. i literally can''t separate out this personal opinion and I''m not going to make an you don''t even want to expend the effort to have an objective viewpoint, then how much do you truly care about actually changing this this is a big part of why i''ve been so unhappy lately, ever since the last time anything about trans characters came you should have told us. If there''s something that we''re doing that doesn''t sit right with you, and it affects you that it''s bottled up inside you and comes out in a wave of anger like this, then it needs to be said. We can''t read your mind. Maybe I''m reading what you wrote wrong, or interpreting it wrong or something, but you seem to think we''re doing this out of some sort of malice, that we''re contributing to some great evil. That we''re bad people. we''re not. What we is a group of people that share ideas and talk to each other, and if you think we''re making a wrong decision or we''re being dumb about something, you say it before it gets to this if i was around idk if there was that much i could have is absolute, bullshit. We are a team. We like a team. We share ideas and listen to each other, and make a decision together. I''m actually a bit insulted that you seem to have absolutely no faith in us to listen to you or your ideas. Who do you think we make decisions based on what makes sense and what is logical. I don''t make decisions to make other people feel bad or feel good or whatever. Yeah, Kai''s PM pissed me off a lot, but I didn''t write the draft to spite her or to her I wrote the draft to logically and clearly lay out the reasons for our decision, which is from our OOC feelings about transgender what you are asking is for an exception to realism, and that''s fine. But we have to be clear about that point. We are not a group of fucking monsters running this game. We are not and we are certainly not singling out our transgendered players. We made an decision that sense with our IC can make transgendered they just to play them actual opinion about this? I''m still pissed at Kai''s initial PM, and I still hold the same opinions that I did in my first post, but I actually sort of agree with you. I''m okay with removing the top-of-each-thread rule, but I think the ''sex'' in the profile must remain accurate to the character''s biological sex, and a prominent note in the profile must be made. Why? Because characters are and a character''s sex is as integral to other characters as their physical appearance. is innate, it is sensed right off the bat. It is and players have been roleplaying this way for a very, very long time. I don''t feel this is the same level as flute-playing; I feel like this is greater than that, just because it''s such an integral part of Again - these are not humans. If these were humans, I would not care for this rule. But they''re and not only is it confusing for other players to read and write about their character scenting a male Luperci, but it''s extremely and agree with what you''re saying about feelings, but listing a character''s internal gender as their is just inaccurate in all senses. I don''t want to confuse other players, and I don''t want to pretend that biological sex doesn''t exist because it does. Maybe we can rename the field to and have that filled in accurately, but I still think a note in the profile must be made either discuss this. We pretty much never make decisions that are set in stone. It''s not as though we have just murdered someone and can never ever take it back, so it shouldn''t be treated like that - and we should be able to discuss this in a clear, calm, and logical way.', '',

Join the Fold', Wee bit long because of the chilluns, but yay Luca! dressed in his richest garments: his heavy cloak, brown trousers, and leather jerkin. About his waist he''d belted his sword Oathkeeper to the left and his jeweled dagger to the right. The growing ends of his mane were chopped off in the favor of a shorter more orderly style in anticipation of the warmer months. He ruffled the back of it, content with it’s length and pushed open the great double doors of the hall. The earthy hued Lune grinned his crooked grin in return to Jazper’s welcoming smile. He instructed his nearly grown pups to take their Guinevere looked excited Tristan feigned disinterest. He left a gap between himself and his sister and slouched into his chair, disheveled mane falling into his face. Both were simply dressed. Guinevere wore her father’s old linen shirt with a worn belt at the waist. While Tristan, had taken another- the flashier black button up, and an old pair of jeans. Alistair didn’t have his mate’s flair for getting his pups ready and they seemed old enough to want to dress themselves. Guinevere’s mane was loose and reminiscent of her mother’s. Waves of wine red tresses draped her shoulders and back in an elegant curtain. Her ghost green eyes were lit up as she peered eagerly at her father and standing to the side of Jazper, swelled with pride as Lorenzo took his oath. There on his lips was the barest hint of a smile and his gaze was unreadable. He was neutral without and nostalgic within, a whirling storm of emotion and memory. Because of Casa di Cavalieri Alistair knew what it was to swear fealty to a good and generous king. Had his life been any different he might not have been able to say that. He would be doomed to enact bloody punishment on a battlefield that should have never been. Hopelessly resigned to live or die by the sword in a blood feud with no real end and no true cause. It was heady to hear his brother swear to him as well as Jazper. Alistair wanted to be worthy of his trust. He wanted it said that he served just as valiantly and just as honorably as the Sun King beside bowed in return and once Lorenzo had taken his cloak and moved aside, Alistair stepped forward. He called the Knight forward. The Lune addressed the new Animale in short one-word commands. His face was a mask of neutrality as he turned to the crowd. someone had told me six moons ago this day was coming, I would have laughed in their face. The Luca I knew then...He wasn’t a knight.

Her sister mentioned she’d heard someone talking about the library and that there was information about the gods there, so Izrian was determined on this cold day to do so. It was too cold to practice hunting or try and convince Ahti to wrestle and spar with her.

The dark king shrugged as he looked the move south Anathema had become rather quiet. Though this was what the dark male wanted he wanted to get some of the unneeded pressure off. The move had proved to be in the best interest of the pack. He smiled as he adjusted the strap that held the large scythe to his back.

and jill went up the hill.', had found a new game. Admittedly it wasn''t a very difficult game to play, but it was a fun one. And one that made him feel slightly sick. Those games were the best games. threadbare blanket of fog swam around the base of the hills. The tops remained bare. They reared out of the grey like the back of a great beast swimming through a petulant sea. Up the back of the beast ran a Luperci, covered in splotches and breathless. It would get to the top, flop down on its stomach and, with a loud squeal, push itself down again, rolling, tumbling into the mist. The fog swallowed it up whole and then, after a ripple and a wave, spit it back out again at the base of a neighbouring hill. With each dizzying loop, its ascent became wobblier until it was zig-zagging and half stumbling. Soon it all became a bit too much and it flopped down on its back at the top of the hill, staring up at the sky, grinning an idiotic panted as he watched the sky spin. It was a mess of greys, a nondescript skyscape that promised neither sun nor rain, only a mugginess that made your fur frizzy and your clothes slightly damp. Luckily, Snufkin didn''t have any clothes to get damp in. Snufkin felt like his eyes were rolling about in his head like little marbles, clacking into each other and making the world look all squiggly. He liked this game he had found. It made everything look different. For a few fleeting seconds you didn''t know what was up and what down. Colours would blend and mix into a pinwheel of nausea, his stomach swooping with each roll until everything went grey and he was buffeted with a chilly, refreshing wetness. Then he would stand, sway, laugh at himself and do it all over only thing that would have made the game better would have been someone to play it with, but not many people had time to play games these days. Snufkin slurped his tongue back into his mouth and wiped the cheek on which it had been resting with a hand. The dizziness was beginning to pass; the sky was starting to stand still once more and his stomach no longer wanted to leap out of his mouth. He sat up, leaning back on his hands and staring, through bright, dazed eyes, at the grey and green horizon thinking, those hills look just like a sea Then, he lay back down, shifted his weight to his right and rolled, like a lifeless snake, down the hill, squealing with laughter until he crashed into someone''s feet at the Hello!

I love Sem already solely on the goat''s welfare, neither canine gave a single fleeting thought to the likelihood that the hunter who had set the snare may still be around. And now she was standing in front of them, fiery eyes blazing anger and nose wrinkled in irritation. It was a novice error and now, Milos feared, they''d have to try and diffuse another potential had other the wolfdog''s posture, the silver woman bristled and stood quickly, taking a step nearer the newcomer.

Aye, yon goat is wiv wu, man! What a neck ye entire exchange happened far too quickly for Milos to intervene. Next to him now, Amara the goat bleated loudly in Semini''s direction as if adding a piece of her own mind, but only seemed to want to catch someone''s attention so she could browse the nearby weeds she didn''t have access to. Clearly her near-death experience hadn''t left much of an impression on the curious animal. Running a hand down the length of his face in exasperation of Sorcha''s explosion, Milos lead Ama to the weeds and tethered her lead - this time - to a sapling nearby. The goat was still safely behind the pair and now seemed quite next to Sorcha, Milos gave her a look of annoyance before turning his attention to the stranger. As my companion here said, Ama - Amara, the goat - belong to us. Not sure if ya caught much of Sorcha''s explanation, but she got away from us and we''ve been lookin'' for her for the better part of the day.

She knew that some had problems with dogs, and it would certainly affect her since her heritage was so obvious, and so she wondered if that was to be the case here. Their family was a mixed bunch, though, and none cared about anyone else’s lineage; it was hard work and a willingness to pitch in and make sure the group survived that mattered. slight frown crossed Lucille’s features as the female started untangling a mess of a fishing net, but she quickly wiped the expression from her face. Several of her pack members would surely have a fit to see fishing supplies in that condition. she listened to the answer to her question about fishing, Lucille slid down from Tiro’s back. He lifted his head and looked over at her, but otherwise did not move.

What attracts yoy to a character?', 'At present two of my three characters are adopted - one of which was picked up today - so here''s what I personally can say on the matter. This, of course, is just my opinion. I am not someone who adopts a that really matter to Freedom, personality, and history. I say freedom because I like to put a little bit of myself into every character I make or adopt, so being able to come up with things like personality traits, quirks, mannerisms, and so on are important to me. Having a few basic points down for what you want the character to be like is fine as long as you don''t outline every single little thing and leave nothing up to the imagination. The same can be said for history. I like picking up a relatively character, one that hasn''t been around all that long - or played all that long - and thus has room to develop and grow as a character. Again, that goes back to being able to have some freedom with what I want to do with the character. I don''t want to have to keep referencing things and worrying about continuity errors or screwing up how the character is supposed to be played because they have a massive history behind them with years of development spanning three different that don''t matter to Name, family, pack, rank, species, appearance, and pretty much everything else. I do not pick a character to adopt because they are or in any way. I look for a character I will enjoy roleplaying, one that I can develop and have grow as I am playing them. A little bit crazy, missing an eye, downright ugly, or even evil? That''s fine! As long as I am able to use these things to come up with plots and threads on my own and have fun with it, I''m happy. That said, certain extremes like being deformed, disabled, transgender, and any other things that would take someone way out of their comfort zone are red flags for me and for others may even be deal breakers. Making a very specific character means you''ll have to wait for a specific person to come along who wants to play a character like that, which could take a long time. far as plots are I prefer those to be or (says the gamer xD), and not something that will make or break the character. I won''t even look at a character if its sole purpose for existing is for a very specific plot, since to me it feels like his or her entire existence has already decided and there''s no room for development or growth. When I adopt a character - or make a character - I intend to play that character for a long time, so plot specific characters to me are not that appealing, especially if he or she is going to die in the end. I love plots, and huge dramatic life changing plots are awesome, but when that alone is the sole reason for a character being around, it''s just not worth - Freedom is good, specifics are bad. Plots are good, one specific plot that defines its existence is that is just I''m sure other people see things differently.', '',

Forward dated to tomorrow, I hope that’s not a problem! had gotten himself in this situation and now he’d have to figure a way day had started off at a relatively normal pace. A quick morning hunt had landed a fat ptarmigan in his stomach and the blood of his victory on his muzzle. He’d picked the bones clean of his quarry and spent a half hour hacking up the feathers that had crept down his esophagus before trotting towards the borders and beginning the day’s patrol. With a belly full of protein and the itching sensation gone from his throat, the hulking male began refreshing markers, investigating tracks of prey coming into their territory and scenting some strange scat he’d found on his way to the pockmarked road being slowly overtaken by nature. He probably should’ve called for someone then, the excrement not belonging to any ungulate he could think of and the closeby scent of stale piss belonging to something of the predator shook it off, thinking it was most likely a wayward fox, nothing he couldn’t deal with on his own. So his mismatched paws led him on a mission, track down what had intruded on their lands and quickly dispatch it from the territory. A fox was hardly an adversary for his physical bulk and the powerful jaws contained in his massive skull, Altair was feeling pretty sure of himself, but that all was about to second sign that should’ve warned him to call for a partner was when he came across a fallen deer. It was barely a yearling, eyes wide and glossed over in death and most of it’s innards missing or scattered in the blood flecked grass. A fox could not have done this. The partially eaten carcass had fang marks littering its knobbly legs and the obvious bite of canine jaws around the neck and rump. However, Altair did not raise his muzzle to call for aid. He was Tharin’s son and a product of his and the late Beta’s training, surely he could handle a rogue wolf on his own! Besides, if he could pull this off by himself, he’d be more than proving his snout sniffed around the dead body, cockiness swelling and heartbeat beginning to pick up a drumming pace at the prospect ahead. The blood was still warm and realization prickled along his spine. He was being watched. The fur along his back became a bristling ridge before the first yipping barks assaulted his senses, coyotes. A snarling growl wrinkled his snout, as the smaller predators emerged from the tall grasses, trying to circle him. He lunged in response, managing to corral them a bit, but they were quick and darted away from his fangs snapping on seemingly playful vocalizations angered him, but the flashes of pink teeth that bobbed and weaved his way spoke otherwise. He stood his ground, aggressively rounding on them when one would try to slip to his side, but four was too much even for a wolf approaching his prime. He soon felt the hot and stinging nip of an adversary to his arm, only able to catch a mouthful of tail fur from the offending coyote. He balked, glancing downward for a second to eye the crimson bloom on his leg. Boom. Another bite, shallow but painful nonetheless to his flank. He snarled, and turned to chase his attacker, but again another laughing yote was too foursome became more ballsy, relentlessly pouncing and snapping at him. This only served to enrage Altair, causing him to recklessly retaliate, growling and snapping right back but only able to deliver one measly blow to the snout of one. They were tiring him out and the Amarok male’s coat was bleeding in more than one spot. He was panting and running out of options, reluctantly giving up more ground once he realized what was happening. If Tharin could see him now, he snorted his disappointment. The obvious choice hovered in the snarling cacophony. He lunged again, barking his adversaries back to the carcass before finally lifting his snout to call for help, a quick howl cut short by the yelp of coyote who’d gotten too close. He could play defensive until help arrived, there was no getting behind him .AltAftermathTab background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: bottom center; solid .AltAftermathTab .inner auto; solid .ALTAFTERMATHTAB .ooc strong.words .AltAftermathTab .ooc strong.words:before content: .AltAftermathTab .ooc strong.words:after content: .AltAftermathTab .ooc p Georgia; .AltAftermathTab .ooc p:last-child .AltAftermathTab p Georgia; .AltAftermathTab b .AltAftermathTab b:before content:open-quote; .AltAftermathTab b:after content:close-quote; by Nat, changes by 'AACA', '',

She hoped she appeared friendly enough. After all, she had never been the one to initiate the greeting of another before. She felt awkward about it, like it was something unnatural to her. She could only hope she was doing it right. It seemed she was on the right track though, as the stranger immediately replied to her call in a friendly manner. Skana was inwardly pleased to see that he hadn’t run away or turned hostile at her approach. She let an appreciative smile spread across her lips. icy blue sights watched him as he stood up, placing his weapon down on a nearby mole hill. No longer an immediate threat, Skana felt the tension leave her muscles. The male’s gaze had followed her own when he noticed her glance about his immediate area, and it appeared as if he had become aware of what the scene might look like to a passerby. He gave a warm smile, something Skana assumed was a way to assure her it wasn’t as bad as it may have looked. She was more curious than she was disturbed though. The sight of a dead deer was not new to her…even if what had happened—or was happening—to the rest of its body parts were. the male gave an amused snort, Skana’s onyx ears flicked to attention, eager to hear what he had to say for the odd scene before her. The tale of how the decapitated beast came to be in pieces as it was now earned the stranger the light laughter of the silver she-wolf. She had expected some serious reply, or dismissal of her question, not what had fallen from the stranger’s tongue! It was silly, but Skana was genuinely amused by it. She ventured a bit closer, her icy blue eyes still aglow with laughter. an honor, Sir, to be chosen for such a noble she chuckled, going along with his fabled story of how he had come to kill the deer. gaze briefly fell to the dead deer as the stranger nudged what was left of the spindle-legged creature, as if he were testing to see if it still held life in its butchered state. Of course, the remains did nothing but fall back into place. When the tawny male spoke up once more, her attention shifted back to him. She raised an invisible brow as she glanced between the stranger and the bodiless head. From the way he spoke about it, it seemed as if he would be getting it from the deer’s remains…somehow. The thought was pushed aside for something that seemed more important about the stranger’s words that were spoken so nonchalantly. she repeated, obviously interested in how he had come to lose something so valuable as leather. He seemed to have managed to keep some of his more modern wares, as it was worn about his legs. brother and she had had little to do with the more…modern, sophisticated items of luperci society. In their travels to Nova Scotia, they had only just encountered a few traders, who had taught them the technical terms for the wide assortment of fabrics and whatnot they had come across in their journey. The siblings had had no use for them in the past though, having believed their more feral lifestyle to be easier to live by. Their father’s stolen cloak was the only things more that the two had come to possess. Silk and leather had seemed to be pretty valuable though, or so that was how the traders made them seem. So, how was it that one would let something get lost like that? straightened up a bit as the male—Chard—introduced himself to her. There was a moment of hesitation on Skana’s part as she glanced down at the extended hand, unsure at first of what he wanted. Her brain was quick to make sense of the matter though. She stepped towards the male—careful to avoid messing up his little arrangement of deer pieces—and let a paw slip out from behind the black material that hid the rest of her body from view. Looking him in the eye, she firmly took his larger hand in a handshake—just like her brother had told her. and introductions finished, Skana made to take her hand back. Her onyx ears flicked at the slight accent that slipped past his lips once more. She had thought she had been hearing things earlier when he first greeted her, but now she felt that she was certain that she had been right before. She chose to not draw attention to it though, instead focusing her attention on why she had ventured over. playful smirk exposed itself as she nodded to his display of deer parts, you could educate me in this…scene you’ve played out here, my curiosity would be greatly She let a hand slink out from under the confines of the cloak once more, thumbing to the large tree in the distance from which she had come. a peculiar looking sight from back would ask Chard about her brother '', '',

deep into that darkness peering', there was one thing that Zalen was glad of, it was that he had instilled in his children a deep respect of authority. Too many wolves he had met had lost all sense of dominance and submission, leading to rude and social inept canines. However, out of his three offspring, Keylo was the one that he had been most worried about. It wasn’t that the dark faced pup was not in tune with pack structure, it was just that he was overtly dominant, and Zalen had expected that eventually he would challenge him. But today did not seem like the day, and even though Keylo’s words were harsh and accusatory, they were without body; the younger male cowered before his Zalen remained with bristled fur and showing teeth, for despite his physical submission, Keylo’s childish words were enough to have made Zalen punish him severely had it been any other wolf, in any other circumstance. It had taken Zalen a long time to come to terms with the murder of his mother, and even longer still to forgive coyotes in general. It would not take Keylo as long, hopefully, to forgive ebony alpha remained silent as Keylo spoke; he was going through the motions of grief, speaking more of Adonia than he was of Lahleia.

imaginary enemy', oh high. It was obvious to see that this male was just as awkward as Panda could be at some times, and it was slightly funny that he was with as pretty as he was. Pretty, Handsome, whichever one he wanted to be called. Panda couldn''t tell what the male''s sexuality was just by looking at him, but he seemed like he might be pretty straight despite his rather....slight femininity. It seemed as if the other was uncomfortable, which in turn made Panda slightly uncomfortable. She wanted him to be comfortable, so she could be as well but she didn''t know what would make his aura be less... erratic. He did not know her, nor she knowing him, so it was hard for her to act accordingly. His horse seemed to be less anxious now though, which made the shaman happy. She smiled to the greeting of the steed and her tail wagged at her before she looked back at the owner of the steed. She wondered where they were from, what kind of dog he was, and if he was going to join any pack, or if he was just going to stay a loner. She''d love to see him around the mountain wolf pack, but she was not one to really recruit members. She would mention the pack though. When he had informed her that he was a mere wanderer and he did not know the area all that well, the smile that was on her face slightly faded as she looked down at the ground for a moment. that''s the woman spoke, as her eyes rebounded and came back up to look at the long haired dog-man and she smiled once more. She took a drag of the short cigarette that Venom had handed to her and then she flicked the butt of it so that the ash would fall to the ground before she exhaled the smoke to the right of the male, trying not to blow it in his face or anything for it would be rude to do so. The male went on to speak about not wanting any trouble either, and Panda nodded her head a few times before she took another drag of her cigarette and then she flicked it off into the dirt. She exhaled the smoke again, away from the male. Where are ya from, if you don''t mind me the female asked the male as she took a small step forward, her hips swaying lightly as she took that step and she held the same smile on her maw as she stood there. Venom slowly moved back towards Korosk and he went into the bags to pull out a map that they had. It was a generalized map, and they didn''t have many of the locations of the packs that they were trying to go to, so they couldn''t really tell where they were supposed to go. Venom took out the map either way and marked their location on it with a pen that he had been keeping in his pocket. He put a small ''x'' on the forest, saying that there was no pack there. What direction did you come from? Do you asked the woman to the male as she glanced over as the chocolate male as she thought about how to go about getting them on the right track back to where they were supposed to go. She wanted to get to New Dawn before there was any more trouble made with them.

He was strong and that strength still flowed through him, giving him energy and life, giving him the gall to ignore his wounds as his eyes met with hers. They were a perfect shade of blue, an aquamarie that reminded him of the ice pools of his old home. He was sent back years in that one moment, to when everything was right and good with his world. Everglades were bright, they spoke of endless forests and the wild untamed lands he had come from. Blood, the lion''s blood dripped from his jaws; and he was ancient in that she nodded to his question and relief flowed through him, much more than it should for a simple stranger female. She came closer to him and dropped down to inspect the injury afforded him by his protection. Such things were a price he was willing to pay. There came a new pain too now, that his leg was of the ground and he twisted as she spoke to him, there was a second gash upon the right side of him, a shallower one clawed into his flank that he had not noticed. Probably from a rear paw. He rumbled in his chest, an irritated nodded his head back towards the direction he had come from, there.

After all, she had only ever known the Rousseau boy in Lupus form because he shift. She had had this conversation with adults before, how some canines could shift but chose not to or how some preferred to be more versatile utilize all their forms equally or how some couldn''t shift at all because they were non-Luperci. That''s what she knew Arno to be: non-Luperci. he couldn''t steady, scrutinizing eyes, Thyri watched the umber male lean over to free his bandages from the grasp of the tree''s roots lifting her big ears at the unconcealed grunt. It was that sound that brought her attention to the young man''s wrappings, stark against his darker fur, and tilted her head just slightly to the side with curiosity. Was he hurt? What happened to him? Suddenly, a hundred important questions vied for her attention and the young Dawnbringer felt very eager to get over to him so she could observe him more closely. She paced at the river bank across from where Arno stood, lifting and setting her paws impatiently. The water was deep here and cold. She didn''t think it would be wise to try and cross here, even though it would be a straight shot. But she didn''t want to try and find an easier way across either for fear he would try to flee, never mind he, too, would need to cross in a different location. And not that he appeared to be moving very quickly in his current state, was already talking to her now so, with a huff of annoyance, the blonde girl sat her rotund rump down on the bank and decided to carry on their conversation with the river between them for the time being.

Creepy and Spooky', No worries, my dear! This is the bunker I''m kind of thinking they find: m m sorry for the crude distraction. I wasn''t sure what else to do were odd animals, Milos decided as he listened to Lucille''s description of the books, chuckling lightly with her. He could imagine how enthralled he would have been to be read such horrifying tales as a pup; at least humans also seemed to have had some handle on storytelling. Perhaps it would be worth his while to learn to read some day. He agreed with a grin. like they''d''ve been easy enough t'' hunt anyway; don''t seem so bright, after He added, mimicking Lucille''s thoughts. pulled away from the old tales, Milos gazed around at the buildings around the outskirts of the Ruins and contemplated the selections. Nothing looked particularly promising but the wolfdog wanted to look all the same, particularly inside the establishment reading ''Antiques'' in faded letters on a cockeyed sign. Being illterate, Milos couldn''t read the sign but there were interesting smells from inside - old, ancient smells - that peaked his interest. Before doing anything, though, a familiar feeling tugged at his bladder. Milos glanced at Lucille apologetically, one, He responded, pointing at the antiques shop, sheepish look on his features. gotta gimme a moment, if ya padded further into the dead woods, dry leaves crinkling underpaw, before lowering his shorts to make water.

From what he could tell, he appeared to be on some sort of slant, head facing upwards more than his tail, and the walls of dead foliage and earth rising up form either side of him were reminiscent of an entryway of sorts. He moaned and gasped before pushing himself up on sprawled hands, squinting behind him where he''d fallen. Above him had been solid ground, directly underneath which lay a doorway.

Rising from the bed wasn''t as much of a struggle anymore, though his thighs still ached in protest when he straightened. He stretched them out, one after another until he could stand entirely upright. Yawning he stretched and pulled his pants on, fumbling through the laces in his drowsy state, though somehow he managed. Next he lazily strapped his belt about him, feeling the customary weight of his bastard sword at his hip. He was about to take the lavish grey cloak from its peg when he heard the scampering of tiny feet, and looked down to see the regal mouse, his brown fur ruffled from sleep. His mouth was wide, sharp yellowed teeth being revealed as he yawned sharply, and blinked sleepily up at the hybrid, who smiled fondly. morning, The rodent leaped on one of his feet and climbed the wolfdog''s pant let with his sharp little claws, then hopped into Alister''s waiting palm and climbed up his arm and onto his shoulder. He''d done this often in the short time, they''d known each other, and Alister was convinced it was because he enjoyed the view. The world was an entirely different place from a height, and the brown mouse seemed eager to explore it. He peered into the hybrid''s hazel eyes, before climbing up into his mane and onto the top of his head. The knightly man chuckled and reached for the mouse''s tail, picking him up by it, something he''d been pleased to find didn''t hurt the small creature, no matter how much he disliked it, and placed him on his bedside table. It was safer this way, it spared the man from the wrath of his wicked sharp front teeth. he sighed. to work, I had been a few days since his return from the northern territories, and it was work as usual. The shield he''d been crafting was now at a point he could be proud of, and was already planning to present it to its new owner. He was quite pleased with his work, though it had been a pain-staking process, and while crafting he had come to the realization that he still had much to learn when it came to wood-working. Regardless, he was pleased with the result, and had only one more thing that needed doing. He grinned at the thought. It was time to test it''s strength, and determine if it was truly ready for combat. His tail wagged at the thought, and he gathered the newly crafted shield, putting his hand through the metal handles, while he swept the cloak about his shoulders with the other, knightly man bid goodbye to Arthur and left out the open doorway, locking the room up tight, as he was like to do now. He didn''t want to open his door to find a surprise guest awaiting him. He''d made that mistake before, and he wasn''t about to do it again. He took the stairs up to the main hall, eager to head up and out to the training yard, perhaps call upon one of his pack-mates to assist him as he tested the shield’s construction? His brown ears pricked forward with the sound of combat as he entered the high-ceilinged hall. he was dressed in his usual garb, his silhouette was altogether impressive, mainly due to the presence of the lavish grey cloak that had been a gift from Jazper and Alyssum. It settled regally about his muscular frame, its deer fur lined mantle a mark of his rank within the pack. He’d rid himself of his own pathetically patched green cloak the very day Jazper had made the announcement, and never neglected to don the new one, for the simple reason that he liked it. Alister liked the way it made him look, especially.

Thankfully, with quick thinking and preventative methods, Sapiens were relatively unaffected by the down by this initial success of branching out to the packs, invites were set out to all other local packs, for the Sapiens intended to hold a grand ball.

The last thing Kennedy wanted was more death and came the topic of their Bellator, or who would be their former one.

I haven''t really been feeling too overwhelmed as of late, and I know I should really still reach out to her because the problems are not going to go away until they are addressed, but I don''t feel like this is the right time I don''t even know the right time would be, honestly. I just really feel like she''s not going to take what I have to say kindly and she might even look at me differently afterwards. I guess I''m paranoid that because I know she''s really controlling over what she does with AT that she might assume that I''m addressing issues maliciously. planned to write up the message two weekends ago, but as I said, I''m stalling because I''m unsure of the outcome and whether I want to deal with an outcome that could go awry. I am also afraid that if she brings it up to me on AIM, its gonna turn into a full on fight again. So, I''m currently stuck at what I should address, if anything even, and how I should address it without seeming malicious in any type of for reaching out to me, by the way! Maybe you guys will give me the push I need! I feel like she''s vilifying Marie, and making her out to be some sort of madwoman who''s going to snap at everything she says - and while yes, the conversation we saw wasn''t ideal, Marie wasn''t exactly blowing up at Sammie or raging at her, either. Maybe I''m being a dick, but I feel like all she''s really doing now is trying to get us to send Marie an PM by trying to convince us that Marie is volatile yes, it''s a possibility that Marie will take what you have to say poorly. But one of the responsibilities of being a leader is being able to communicate your feelings to your co-leaders, and one of the side effects of this responsibility is the chance that said co-leader won''t take it well. Anger and misunderstandings are potential side effects of any sort of communication, especially where leadership is concerned. We totally get that confrontation is you don''t know that Marie will be upset with you at all - as we mentioned, she may not even be aware of what she''s doing, or how it affects you. We encourage you to hope for the best in Marie, and not to assume the worst of her; if she become angry with you, or is unresponsive to your concerns, we can definitely become involved. At that point, it would be clear that you did try to speak to her, but to no avail - and if she reply in a volatile manner, it would also be a matter of respect and rudeness, which deals with rules on the board-wide scale. We would then deal with the issue accordingly; you would absolutely not be forced to deal with any overwhelming outcomes on your probably won''t ever be a time to bring up a hard topic, but since this does seem like an ongoing issue, we feel that the sooner it''s addressed, the far as how to address your issues, perhaps a friendly approach would work best? Try to avoid an tone - for example, you could word sentences like feel like I do the brunt of the rather than something like don''t do any Addressing your concerns in a mature, non-accusatory manner that presents how you feel would likely go a long way in getting Marie to understanding your you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reply to this PM.

sammiie re: and AT leadership', you for getting back to me again! I had given it some thought as far as you guys contacting her first (rolled some scenarios over in my head), and figured that if she were to confront me about it, I could always just say that I asked you guys for advice about the situation and didn''t want to confront her due to what happened last time (the AIM convo). I don''t think she''s going to handle it well either way. From what I''ve observed, Marie is either over-controlling or she''s not involved; there''s no perfect Marie in between. The way she speaks to me over AIM makes it hard to decipher what kind of person she is, how she acts, etc. When she was doing updates, she''d get mad at me for correcting pages without running it by her first (when they were minor edits like grammar, typos, coding things, etc.), yet now, she doesn''t care about any of the updates I do, but yet she''s not helping me at all either. If I were the only leader, it would be different. I think the only reason this is stressing me out is because I still have to check in with her before I change something or update something a certain way, and she''s not even helping with anything that I''m doing :| Or when she does, I have to STILL check over her updates to make sure things are done properly, professionally, correctly, timely, etc. you guys think that it would be best for me to reach out to her first, I will send her a PM. However, I''m not really sure how I should go about that ? Should I basically touch base on basically all the things I''ve mentioned to you guys here, or do you think I should leave some things out? What do you guys think as far as my situation think that she should PM Marie first; although I agree that Marie was being dismissive in the AIM log, I think Sammie''s being a bit over-sensitive and exaggerating how Marie might react. think it''s important to at least try for communication and resolution instead of jumping to her in so to speak (idk why, but I get the impression that Sammie wants us to just remove Marie instead of working with Marie to solve these problems. The the in the last PM, I were the only in this one, etc). she can talk about how much Marie will blow up at her and won''t listen to her all she wants, but that''s just guesswork unless she actually tries to talk to up for her to PM Marie about pretty much everything she told us; communication (talk about Ceri thing, provide logs if (having to check in with Marie for every little thing) Marie helping out open to new ideas listening to co-leaders (talk about dismissive attitude when discussing Are we going to talk to Alex?

- We Pick Ourselves Undone', so deep I thought I''d they are so that moment, she cursed the taste of alcohol on her breath, because it made the reality of her intentions seem clouded. This was the clearest she had ever thought about him, about her, about though. Before she had always pushed something in front of those feelings, but the alcohol took away that inhibition and left her bare. A bareness that she had felt was being pushed away by Basil. Though what had she expected from the foolish words made her blink owlishly at him. Was she being foolish, had he not meant it the way she had taken it? Certainly the cascade - and especially for Basil, this was quite the flurry of a speech - of words that came afterward assured her that she had misunderstood. Her heart sang, and in it were the words wants me, he wants me, he wants Though in the same thought, she wondered, what about touch of his fingers on her cheek caused her eyes to close a bit, half-lidded and pleased. A faint smile curled the edges of her lips and she leaned into the touch, small though it was. ami, it was the alcohol that has lifted from my eyes the lies I told myself. That you weren''t important, that there was no reason I always thought of you when I felt sad, or why I thought to come see you now.

you want I''ll sell you a life story', Prompt (Donate to charity) - Lupus - hunting deer! Open to others? cool breeze tickled the back of Ascher''s neck as he bent his head to examine some leaves. The foliage had been pressed into the ground by a hoof, flattened by the weight of a young deer. From the faint remnants of scent, Ascher guessed the deer had spent time here recently before moving on. The Stormbringer''s fountain blue eyes moved to the tangle of roots and shrubbery which lay a few feet ahead of him; his gaze rested there for a moment before he lifted his head and padded forward, inhaling to gauge whether he was going in the right hadn''t quite managed to pick up where he''d left off in Vinatta. That was too difficult when so much within the pack had grown and changed – he would have sworn Bel and Orvar had each grown by a foot, and Drin had a new brood with Bran. Ascher was eager to score some face time with the new Father, to find out how his cousin was handling this new role, but he had been preoccupied. He still felt as if he were on a knife edge, teetering with every gust of wind, and standing on a knife edge left no room for the usual pursuits had failed to center the Eljun Rikr. He''d tried to exercise his brain, but perhaps he had pushed himself too hard and too fast; it had been a long six weeks where his thoughts had been consumed by finding his brother, and then finding his way back. Whenever he thought his brain was rested enough to study his books, another worry crept in. exercise was his last resort. Weeks of travelling had hardened the Eljun''s body somewhat; living without the comfort of a house had toughened his paw pads and sharpened his senses. Now was the time to try and capitalize on these changes with a stalked through the trees with regular checks on his proximity to the path the deer had taken. The stalking element of the hunt was probably Asch''s favourite part – until the deer was sighted, it was like piecing together clues to the mystery of how, why and when his prey had moved. In Lupus form Ascher was able to move quickly enough to make up some hesitated, weighing up his odds and hoping that someone else might be out in the forest today with a hungry belly and some time to '', 
H-hello.', Well, I showed this game to a very good friend that I''ve known for most of my life, and she said that it looked fun. She might have just said that though, to be nice. If she actually wanted to play however, she''d have a tough time posting. She has to walk to the nearest McDonald''s just to get good internet. I though about asking if she would want to come to my house and do posts there, but now I moved pretty far away. And she often says stuff like what you said. What a weird coincidence, felt sort of bad for making Nyx yelp and squirm on top of him, but he didn''t want her to risk injuring her foot or arm again. Walking along with Nyx on his shoulders, the girl started stuttering like crazy again, obviously agitated by the sudden change of transportation. Her tiny hands wrapped around his chin, giving Lukos a strange sense of calm. The grey wolf knew he''d never allow the girl to fall to the ground, so he casually smiled while she protested. He hope he didn''t stir up any unwanted memories by giving that little speech, making Nyx more closed up than she was.

It was obvious from the look on her face and her body language that she was exstatic to be around the pups, much the same reaction that Hartt had to them. Many females, and even some males, had strong parenting instincts and were always willing to interact with young ones. There were many wolves who could not stand puppies, and were wary of them, and that was ok two pups were immediately into play mode when Lucia snapped at them; they giggled and warbled in puppy language. Zalen lifted himself up onto his long limbs and gave a stretch, before jumping down from his perch to barrel into them, claiming Petra in his large paws and rolling away with her.

For so long the Knight believed it to be okay to appear a little weak. Everyone was, inside. They were only mortal, and he refused to lie to others and himself. Weakness could be a strength, he would argue. He’d never been too good at steeling himself, and when he killed, even if there was no other choice, he did so with a heavy beliefs were so contrary, they awed and confused Alistair more than anything. In this circumstance the Japanese man’s confession chilled him. He could feel the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end, as well as those along his spine, but continuously refused to think of Ryuu as a cold-hearted killer. No, there had to be something more, so he prodded him when he probably should have let things be. He was oblivious to the white male’s silent pleas, and was eager to hear him out, determined stood still and hung on his every word, aware of Ryuu’s stalling, but gracefully allowing it. His brows were furrowed as he listened to the sobering and mournful truth. It that had happened to Lola...His heart grew heavy, and his ears might have fallen back were it not for Ryuu’s continued explanation. They grew rigid when he mentioned death, how he’d hung his servants bodies. That, was truly sickening, and the word ‘slave’ soured the taste in the hybrid’s mouth. But, those were questions for later, now, he was shaking his not your fault, Ryuu.

Her fluffy appearance compared to the brindle appearance of the wolf, was different, but Carya felt comfortable around the female. She was not offensive to her, and thus posed no threat to her. If Carya ever got the feeling that the brindle would hurt her, instead of fighting, Carya was always ready to run, always ready to high-tail it out of the place that caused her harm and return to Vinatta.

There were always signs when the former residencies were nearby – the odd stone or block of wood, scorch marks from fires and occasionally a building which still stood. It was like that in Amherst, but Halifax was on a different and slender fingertips grazed mortar and wood, leaf and bark in turn as Ascher weaved a simple path through the clustered buildings.

This place was a treasure trove of information, he was sure, although some artefacts would be open to interpretation.

It made her seem young, which by all accounts from what she could gather on a once-over told her that she was young. But her attention was ultimately drawn back to the horse, and she felt the prickle of her hackles beneath her cloak rise at the uncommon size and build of the creature. Horses were strange things to her, though she had seen her fair share of them through travel. Nikita had been tugging one along in tow the day he had found her, too. But it had not been like that she returned, her accent no doubt anything to further contrast the two-toned luperci, at least Zdravka felt she sounded confident.

Azucena had left the house earlier, but left her things behind. She left her spear leaning against the inner wall on the front door just in case she would need to come back for it. It was about time that she brought a fresh kill home for her and Till, and it wouldn’t hurt to at least attempt to find food. It wasn’t often that she didn’t have to walk far to pick up a scent of some food nearby.

And of course, there was always that instance of the scent of an outsider or the scent of another the deep snow and her horse lingering nearby, Azucena proceeded towards the food smell in her Secui form. Luckily, even with her stocky legs, it was less hard to run in the deep snow when she was a thicker built canine than in her natural form. Her usually graceful, elegant canter turned into a sweaty, messy lope with snow being kicked up and fluffed behind her and her tongue lolling out of the side of her mouth. Aesthetics aside, though, she eventually came upon the source of the scent – and the of was much more graceful than she was, even in a smaller form.

She had to push herself harder to keep up with him, but he was too quick, too elegant and too graceful for her shorter legs. She assumed that she was built for endurance, and less for running fast. She could probably outrun him if it were a long run – because by the time he was tried, she’d still be going any… she called to him, both their eyes on the prize ahead.

That fact had still not changed. Even now, with just a simple hunt, Drahnor found himself wanting to catch whatever it was that his brother was after just to get back at the older wolf-dog. It was a perfect plot, one that couldn''t really be used against him, or so he thought. With the bow stretched slightly in front of himself and his eyes on the path ahead, he moved somewhat closer to Honrin, silent for the most part since the older male chose not to speak or acknowledge his presence. Honrin, Drahnor was not yet a perfected hunter and what little bit of prey he had caught had always been in his secui form and with his claws and hands since he was still highly accustomed to life as a four legged individual. Azure eyes followed the path they were on, glancing every now and then at his feet as if to make sure that he didn''t accidentally break a twig beneath his feet. It was best to follow an older canine''s example. Finally, with a brief pause, Honrin spoke and it wasn''t to chide him even though the ivory furred wolf-dog definitely didn''t seem overly happy about a doubt, Drahnor understood exactly what his brother meant when he cast his eyes upon the ground and the prints that had been made. Gently, his gaze cast toward the dense forestry ahead of himself, a small grin perking at his lips. With a nod toward Honrin, Drahnor lifted slightly, letting the tension that pulled at the line of his bow lessen as he took the advantage to silently step up to the small trees that lined the edge. There, in the tree, bark had been stripped from its grasp, flecks scattered on the ground near his feet. seems some of them still make mistakes. This couldn''t have been too long.

Honrin and Keldava had taught him the rest. The mahogany brujo''s hushed voice barely went noticed by the world around him. In the distance, he couldn''t spot much. While Honrin could pick out the footsteps through the earth, Drahnor could pay attention to the surrounding vegetation for hints that whatever was in their in the wooded area around Cercatori was both an experience Drahnor Wolfe VI could have learned to deal without and one that he probably needed to learn. It was with a sudden jolt that he awoke, just as his arms slipped free of their circled hold on the rough bark of the tree. With a jerk, he righted himself, not without gaining a few uncoordinated scratches through his fur at his pale skin beneath. With both his arms in front of himself, he lowered his stocky build from the tree limb he''d stretched out on the night before, careful that he caught himself with both hands when he spun around, feet extended to take the next branch he would have come to. With a sudden realization, a thought sprang in his mind unbidden which almost made him curse beneath his breath. The night before had been stretched and long and he now remembered that his ascent up the tree had not been without mistake. Beneath him, the scarred trunk of the tree branch that had been there before was a haughty stretched himself out thin, a long breath caressing through his lungs before blowing back the thick reddish brown mane from his face. A grin stretched cleanly across his maw before he glanced down toward the ground with those cheerful, bright turquoise eyes of his. It wasn''t too far of a drop. Nothing he wouldn''t enjoy. Near the bottom of the tree, tied to it with a thin red lace which obviously meant it had been left behind by Leviothan, something long and thin seemed to stretch firmly against the tree. He let go without second thought, neither taking in another breath or holding it as he landed with a harsh oomph of sound escaping his lips, the air near forced out of his lungs, his legs slightly jarred, but shook him near to his foundation, pale alabaster hand moving to climb over his muscled, toned abdomen. In his hair, the assorted trinkets, mostly a few coins and beads, seemed to clink together annoyingly, no sound coming of it thankfully. He turned around without sound once he''d settled himself, quickly moving to the tree where a single arrow had been tethered in place, a near brick brown colored shaft with a white, black and grey display of feathers near the coloring of his own body had been locked in to form its fletching. He growled softly at the thought that Levi had made him something of such worth before slowly loosening it with a single sharp claw. The wolfdog hadn''t yet recovered from his wrestling match with Leviothan, despite the fact that he''d nearly won over the cinder colored coywolf he called his brother-in-law. There was still much to be learned, much to be taught and the only way he was going to learn anything was through trial and work.

None of the others wore clothes like he did, nonetheless hair decorations that he''d gotten from a loner at the borders. While all of the beads meant something to him, one way or another, Drahnor knew that sometimes his mother only wanted a hint that he was still a Wolfe-Denahlii at heart and that was why he never gave up on family. While things might not have been extremely easy with finding out that Keldava or even Dalgina weren''t as close to the family as Honrin or himself were, he didn''t feel necessarily bad about any of them. fact, he loved them all more then he could even manage to say. That was why, seeing his mother now, he could barely withhold the secret happiness that was streaking through his blood. It didn''t help that his tail was against him in this act.

It hadn''t been long since she''d healed. He was sure that the wrong move could reopen wounds, especially if danger came out to bite them in the arse, but nothing could take this from him, even if it held a certain sorrow that he hoped never to feel again.

Lupus form, inland Shattered Coast just south of Lowry is by The young male was growing more and more comfortable with the pack grounds every day, but he didn’t quite feel like spending all his time there yet. He took frequent trips out into the neutral territories surrounding the pack, a fact that he thought Wayne noticed. He continued to disregard the cowboy in his comings and goings, though, and made sure to always return with something, whether firewood or prey, for Casa di Today, Lowry wanted to spend all of his time hunting and scouring the lands south of where he’d explored beforehand. The coastland especially caught his eye, the salt wind flattening the grass in short bursts, the thinly rolling landscape spread out before him. He skirted the woodlands and struck out due south instead, running along in his tiny Lupus form, his possessions safely left in his room at the fort It became evident quite quickly that there wouldn’t be a lot of easy food toward the actual coast, but he stuck to the inland plains and scampered after runty rabbits. The creatures disappeared into their warrens more often than not, quickly frustrating Lowry, who’d by this point actually gotten hungry rather than wanting to hunt for the other Cavaliers. When one rabbit literally disappeared under his nose, when he could almost touch its little bunny tail with his chin, the boy skidded to a halt. Splay-legged and breathing hard, Lowry immediately began to bark and yap down into the warren, throwing a tantrum and beginning to dig rapidly, scraping away at the dirt img p new roman'', times, serif; '', '',

Deep roots are not reached by the frost', she was no longer a young Aeska, the dark femme couldn''t help but feel a puppy-like exuberance when the day finally came and the Ostara Spring Festival began. She had heard so many wonderful things about it but all of the stories paled in comparison to the actual event. The first thing that hit her when she arrived was all of the nearly overwhelming sights and sounds and smells. Spring had at last returned to Vinátta, and where the listless greyscale of winter had drained all the life and color from the realm the verdant brush of spring had brought it all back with explosions of green all through the deciduous trees and grassy knolls. The land was alive again. Wafting upon the cool breeze the tantalizing scents of fresh grass and flower buds mingled with the delectable aroma of food cooking while the sounds of laughter and merriment could be heard all usually in the company of her family, had instead decided to venture off on her own that day, hoping to arrive early so that she could participate in as many games and activities she could. First on her list of things to do was to head over and catch one of Miskuun''s stories – something she felt she was never too old to do – and paint all her hopes and dreams onto one of the carved wooden eggs to be buried later. As she wandered along en route to where the Godja had set up for story time she let her lime green gaze sweep along the many canines already in attendance, meeting eyes with those she recognized and offering a cheery smile to those she didn''t. It was always nice to see the whole pack come together for something jovial and carefree like the Ostara coded by Image by div.DreyBirdOuter background-position:top center; background-repeat:no-repeat; background-color:#fff; solid div.DreyBirdInner div.DreyBirdInner P georgia; div.DreyBirdInner B div.DreyBirdInner A div.DreyBirdOOC text-align:right; verdana; dotted div.DreyBirdCredit verdana; div.DreyBirdCredit A '', '',

He felt old and young all at once, and his path had become one of uncertainty. What he could not find or procure on his own he stole, and so he supported himself and his sisters with fair ease. They had gone—all three of them had gone—but they still had They were the children of sedition; who would really want them, banged up and savage as they Sometimes Marlowe forgot he was a soldier. Sometimes he felt like a liar, as they had called him in Scintilla, except he was so when he said me The rage, though. That was Sometimes it escaped, when he shot the bow too hard or swung his sword with such wroth that the force lingered in his shoulder for hours. He would scrap with Kali if that damned mutt of her''s wasn''t around, and especially if Agrippa was gone, but the real rage that had been building up inside of him never found its way One day, he caught a scrawny wolf lurking around their campsite. Marlowe had killed him without a thought, and been only slightly startled when he saw the weapon. Even with all the eyes they had, traveling as they were familiar in such odd group ways, it was not enough to shake the ever present need for constant vigilance. Marlowe was So he told them, finally, that they had to go. If they did not think it right by fall, they would leave. Winter travel was no stranger to them, and they would have time to prepare.

He didn''t dwell on any other things they spoke of, which pleased Aspirin somewhat. Ridpath didn''t know what to say at first, it seemed, because he mulled over her query for a moment. She waited patiently for his answer, and it didn''t take too terribly long to get one; he told her how he planned to go to a pack of warriors, Casa di Cavalieri. The name was new to her, and she simply nodded—once again, for the nth time—at what he said how she might would fit in with Aniwaya. From the sound of it, they were injuns, but at least they were friendly. Not that the tribal part would turn Aspirin away from it, but she wasn''t sure if she''d fit into a pack like that. she responded vaguely, her eyes searching for the tree she had rested near earlier. Aniwaya... She would remember that name. The hybrid wasn''t sure how living there would be, but she would try to get more information on it when she was closer to the general area of the pack—wherever that was, anyway. should stay away from the ones in the Aspirin repeated as she turned back to Ridpath, confused as to why she should. Were they brutal up there? Ruthless? Mean? She wouldn''t want to go too far north, in that case, but she wanted to at least know why to steer clear of them. so bad up she asked quietly, pushing her knees down on either side of her as her hands clasped together on her thighs. She knew they must''ve either made a bad impression on the male, or he had seen firsthand what they were like, because the way the tone was in his voice told her he didn''t think too fondly of them. He was ordering her bit to go there rather than telling her to, so it must have really been a bad place. p p.first-line b letter-spacing: background-position:top center; background-repeat:no-repeat; .text arial narrow, serif; opacity: text-align:justify; (c) on '', '',

But he was clever, and knew that Drin was his savior. He knew he was different, too different to come from his belly, like Tyris and Taro, and so had to be found. Whenever and wherever Drin found him, the young fox was forever grateful. been in the world less than a year, but life had been like a roller-coaster. Twists and turns around every corner, and no way to predict what might happen yet. He was honestly scared, frightened that his future was short, but Leaf knew that his ma leave, not forever. The fox rubbed his head on her leg, feeling her soft fur like a pillow. giggled with joy when Drin agreed with his idea. And it gave him hope for his independence, that he could make his own path, without needing some support. Indeed, the fox felt the need to help the young. Give them the opportunity to show themselves and have a good beginning of life. Leaf knew he was an expert in the art of and that his endless list of games would go well with Aeska of the pack. Leaf smiled, before listening to her advice about Ivy. frowned slightly, the memory of his adult teeth was vague, though he could picture a lot of chewing and moaning, which sounded right to what his ma was saying. He sort of understood what she meant, but know why this had to happen. He also had something else on his mind. ma... is it just said, frowning as he stared off at the plants around them, ah keep funny around her too. like ah get all hot and buzzy when around, is that too?

Hope Shines Through', for the wait some reason, she expected her brother to respond with rage like she would have – as soon as he heard that she was go out and punish those who did it. However, she supposed there was no way that he act like she would because the demon had been extinguished. There was no one out there to hunt and destroy. Instead of respond with rage, he responded with grief – despite the few moments he stood after she shared that she had been raped. he only knew just how many times she had been raped. If he only knew what she had done in her past to make things He would surely look at her like she was a monster then. He wouldn’t stand by her side if he knew all these wrongdoings she had committed just to selfishly balance out her own was silent for a moment, Nero. Axelle held her own head in her hands, waiting for him to snap. Waiting for that moment that she knew in her own mind would come if she were in his shoes. However, he hadn’t snapped. Instead, he got up from the couch and crossed the room, dropping to his knees before her and somehow still being taller than her sitting form. He promised to protect her and wanted to be with her for the rest of their lives, and that alone almost made her whimper like a little pup. Not being able to talk without bursting out in rare tears herself, Axelle just nodded to his words. Placing a hand on his shoulder, gripping his neck in that loving way she always did to him, she shushed him lovingly. you don’t have to sacrifice the rest of your life for the protection of I can handle myself; I always have, but if you truly want to be one of us – I can’t tell you She paused, squeezing his neck lightly, to Anathema, Then she took him in a weak embrace, remembering her wounds and holding him loosely. she pulled away from their elongated hug, she thought for a moment, looking up at the ceiling. can offer you a den in the Howling Caverns or your own house here in Thackery Village.
